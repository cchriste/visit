These are a collection of scripts for benchmarking the SR mode renderers in
VisIt.  The meat of the work happens in `scaling-pixels.sh', which runs a set
of tests at varying resolutions and processor counts.  The results are stored
in a sqlite3 database named `${HOSTNAME}.db' by default.

At this point, you can develop your own scripts to extract out the information
of interest in the format you want.  Some ready-made scripts to utilize gnuplot
might suit your needs.
    * format-gnu.py takes a database and creates 2 gnuplot data files, one for
      each renderer type.  With the -a option, it will average the rendering
      times appropriately.
      For 2D plots, I suggest using the `smooth unique' option of gnuplot
      rather than the averaging done by the script.  gnuplot does not support a
      similar option for 3D plots.
    * rendering.gnu is a batch gnuplot file which generates a series of plots
      detailing performance.  It uses the output files generated from
      format-gnu.py.
