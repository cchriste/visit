VisIt was unable to open "/data_vobs/VisIt/test/junk.vtk".  Each attempt to open it caused VisIt's metadata server to crash.  This can occur when the file is corrupted, or when the underlying file format has changed and VisIt's readers have not been updated yet, or when the reader VisIt is using for your file format is not robust.  Please check whether the file is corrupted and, if not, contact a VisIt developer.
