dnl Macro: VAC_ARG_WITH3RD
dnl
dnl Programmer: Mark C. Miller
dnl Created:    Tue Oct 21 09:18:59 PDT 2008
dnl
dnl A very helpful third party library macro. What does this macro do?
dnl
dnl A. Prints a nice help message without the caller having to worry about
dnl    formatting. The help message is 'integrated' with a header help
dnl    message that details how to format the arg to --with-xxx options.
dnl B. Unifies and sanitizes the naming of symbols for Make and
dnl    C Pre-Processor. For Makefiles, it defines...
dnl        XXX_INCLUDE (which should probably really be called XXX_CPPFLAGS)
dnl        XXX_LIB     (which should probably really be called XXX_LDFLAGS)
dnl        XXX_TARGET  (used to identify make targets that depend on lib)
dnl    For C Pre-Processor, it defines...
dnl        HAVE_LIBXXX
dnl    For internal configure logic, it defines...
dnl        XXX_LIBFILE (the full path to actual lib file it selected)
dnl C. Handles a variety of ways of formatting the argument to a
dnl    --with-xxx=<withval> command line option to configure where <withval>
dnl    can be any of the following...
dnl       no                      totally disable use of the specified lib
dnl       yes                     use the lib as provided by the platform
dnl       builtin                 use the lib in third party builtin 
dnl       <DIR>[:<DEPLIBS>]       single directory above inc[lude] and lib 
dnl       <IDIR>,<LDIR>[:<DEPLIBS>] separate paths to inc[lude] and lib dirs
dnl    where <DEPLIBS> is an optional set of dependent library paths and flags.
dnl D. Confirms existence and readability of key header file(s) for library.
dnl E. Confirms existence and readability of key library files for library.
dnl F. Handles variance of names of the lib (e.g. silo/siloh5)
dnl G. Handles variance in library extension (e.g. .a/.so/.dylib)
dnl H. Creates symbolic links in VisIt's lib dir for the lib and its
dnl    dependent libs, if any. We may want to use AC_CONFIG_LINKS for this
dnl    instead of how it is currently being handled.
dnl I. Handles defaults specified in config-site files using the symbols
dnl    DEFAULT_XXX_LIBLOC
dnl    DEFAULT_XXX_LIBDEP (optional)
dnl
dnl The arguments are...
dnl $1 = [REQ] library (short) name (e.g. 'hdf5' or 'zlib')
dnl $2 = [OPT] name of (key) header file including its extension (default is $1.h)
dnl $3 = [OPT] name(s) of (key) library file NOT including leading 'lib' or trailing
dnl      extension (default is lib$1.{dylib|so|a})
dnl $4 = [OPT] name of (key) function in library 
dnl $5 = [OPT] help string; the macro itself generates a default
dnl
dnl I would regard this as an m4-minimal/sh-maximal implementation of this
dnl macro. All string processing that can actually be done at configure time
dnl by sh is done so. Only the absolute minimum that has to be done by m4 at
dnl autoconf time is done using m4. In addition, it relies very little on
dnl other, pre-defined autoconf macros. This is primarily due to the
dnl implementor's lack of experience with m4 ;).
dnl
dnl Modififications:
dnl   Mark C. Miller, Thu Nov 20 09:29:37 PST 2008
dnl   Added '0-9' characters to m4_translit invokation. In theory, this should
dnl   NOT be necessary but m4_translit was NOT always getting the '5' in HDF5
dnl   and this change appears to have fixed that. Also, instead of actually
dnl   creating the links to libs here, we now stick the commands for doing that
dnl   into a configure variable that gets substituted into lib/Makefile.in.
dnl   Made it initialize withval to 'no' and initialize with_package. Added
dnl   logic to the action-if-not-given part of AC_ARG_WITH to change withval
dnl   only if DEFAULT specifications actually exist.
