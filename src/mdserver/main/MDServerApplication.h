// ****************************************************************************
// Class: MDServerApplication
//
// Purpose:
//   This class manages several MDServerConnections which are connections to
//   programs that drive the MDServer.
//
// Notes:     This class follows the singleton design pattern. 
//
// Programmer: Brad Whitlock
// Creation:   Fri Nov 17 16:44:32 PST 2000
//
// Modifications:
//   Brad Whitlock, Thu Mar 15 12:47:22 PDT 2001
//   Added a method to remove dead client connections.
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Fri Apr 18 14:57:17 PST 2003
//   I added a debug method that reads the file list and quits.
//
//   Jeremy Meredith, Wed Dec 31 14:12:12 PST 2003
//   Added code to keep track of the client host.  This lets us guess
//   host names better.
//
//   Mark C. Miller, Thu Jun 14 10:26:37 PDT 2007
//   Added method to set cycle number regular expression
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Tue Jun 24 14:58:19 PDT 2008
//   Made a DatabasePluginManager member.
