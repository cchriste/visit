"The visualization window has various modes that affect its behavior and\n"

"The ToggleBoundingBoxMode function toggles bounding box mode on and off.\n"
"When the visualization window is in bounding box mode, any plots it\n"
"contains are hidden while the view is being changed so the window redraws\n"
"faster. \n"
"The ToggleCameraViewMode function toggles camera view mode on and off.\n"
"When the visualization window is in camera view mode, the view is updated\n"
"using any view keyframes that have been defined when VisIt is in keyframing\n"
"mode.\n"
"The ToggleFullFrameMode function toggles fullframe mode on and off. When\n"
"the visualization window is in fullframe mode, the viewport is stretched\n"
"non-uniformly so that it covers most of the visualization window. While not\n"
"maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio, it does make better use of the\n"
"visualization window.\n"
"The ToggleLockTime function turns time locking on and off in a\n"
"visualization window. When time locking is on in a visualization window,\n"
"VisIt creates a database correlation that works for the databases in all\n"
"visualization windows that are time-locked. When you change the time state\n"
"using the time slider for the the afore-mentioned database correlation, it\n"
"has the effect of updating time in all time-locked visualization windows.\n"
"The ToggleLockViewMode function turns lock view mode on and off. When\n"
"windows are in lock view mode, each view change is broadcast to other\n"
"windows that are also in lock view mode. This allows windows containing\n"
"similar plots to be compared easily.\n"
"The ToggleMaintainDataMode and ToggleMaintainViewMode functions force the\n"
"data range and the view, respectively, that was in effect when the mode was\n"
"toggled to be used for all subsequent time states.\n"

"of rotation when the view is changed interactively.\n"

"\n"
"The Turn functions are provided to simplify the removal of material or\n"
"domain subsets. Instead of creating a SILRestriction object, you can use\n"
"the Turn functions to turn materials or domains on or off. The\n"
"TurnMaterialsOn function turns materials on and the TurnMaterialsOff\n"
"function turns them off. The TurnDomainsOn function turns domains on and\n"
"the TurnDomainsOff function turns them off. All of the Turn functions have\n"
"three possible argument lists. When you do not provide any arguments, the\n"
"function applies to all subsets in the SIL so if you called the\n"
"TurnMaterialsOff function with no arguments, all materials would be turned\n"
"off. Calling TurnMaterialsOn with no arguments would turn all materials on.\n"
"All functions can also take a string argument, which is the name of the set\n"
"to modify. For example, you could turn off domain 0 by calling the\n"
"TurnDomainsOff with a single argument of \"domain0\" (or the appropriate\n"
"set name). All of the Turn functions can also be used to modify more than\n"
"one set if you provide a tuple of set names. After you use the Turn\n"
