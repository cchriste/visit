//  Class: avtFacadeFilter
//
//  Purpose:
//      Sometimes a filter is wrapped around another filter or a pipeline of
//      filters.  This can be so that it does a conversion of the attributes or
//      so that it can meet some interface that the original filter does not.
//      This class provides some of the dirty work so that pipelines can be 
//      well-maintained without getting too complicated.
//
//  Programmer: Hank Childs
//  Creation:   April 16, 2002
//
//  Modifications:
//
//    Hank Childs, Thu Feb  5 17:11:06 PST 2004
//    Moved inlined constructor and destructor definitions to .C files
//    because certain compilers have problems with them.
//
//    Hank Childs, Tue Jun  7 14:48:49 PDT 2005
//    Add methods to access all facaded filters, as well as populating common
//    avtFilter methods (release data, perform restriction).
