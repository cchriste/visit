//  Class: avtDataObjectString
//
//  Purpose:
//      A string that a data object can be written to.  This class is not much 
//      more than the STL version (with significantly restricted functionality).
//      It exists because the assembly of the data object string became a
//      serious bottleneck due to the append method.  Re-writing the routines
//      without the append is not worthwhile, so having a class that is less 
//      append-sensitive seems like the best solution.
//
//  Programmer: Hank Childs
//  Creation:   May 25, 2001

//  Modifications:

//    Hank Childs, Sun Sep 16 16:04:39 PDT 2001
//    Re-worked to prevent copying of strings.
