//  Class:  CellReconstructor

//  Purpose:
//    Reconstructs a cell from the given mesh/material.

//    I was able to re-use most of this class for a new isovolume based
//    reconstruction algorithm.  Everything stayed except I made
//    ReconstructCell pure-virtual, and I needed to keep track of whether
//    or not edge points were shared across materials.

//    Renamed Array class to VisItArray to avoid name collisions with
