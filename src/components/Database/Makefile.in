# Modifications:
#
#    Hank Childs, Thu Mar  8 15:27:10 PST 2001
#    Totally re-wrote this Makefile as a result of splitting Database directory
#    into subdirectories.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu May 10 14:17:51 PDT 2001
#    Made it create libdatabase.a instead of add to libpipeline.a.
#    Made it create a shared library, and do the subdirs before the library.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon May 14 12:06:05 PDT 2001
#    Fixed a tiny bug.
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed Jun 13 15:23:51 PDT 2001
#    Removed SIL and Exceptions directories.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jun 25 21:31:15 PDT 2001
#    Added _ser or _par extension to library names.
#

#    Added some required libraries for AIX.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 10:36:22 PDT 2001
#    Changed library building: the LIB targets has no extension, and
#    either LIBSINGLETARGETS or LIBMULTITARGETS must be included
#    in addition to TARGETS depending on whether the library is build
#    from object files in one directory or multiple subdirectories.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Oct 25 13:01:54 PDT 2001
#    Moved MIR into this directory.  Added the Ghost directory.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jan 16 09:54:48 PST 2002
#    Make this library build serial and parallel versions concurrently.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Mar 11 16:44:39 PST 2002
#    Made this library build in one pass from this directory.
#
#    Hank Childs, Thu Mar 21 11:18:30 PST 2002
#    Added avtFileDescriptorManager.
#
#    Hank Childs, Fri May 24 16:31:43 PDT 2002
#    Added STL reader.
#
#    Hank Childs, Tue May 28 14:51:20 PDT 2002
#    Added Curver reader.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jul  3 13:22:58 PDT 2002
#    Added SUBDIRS back in.  It was still needed.
#
#    Hank Childs, Thu Jul  4 13:39:44 PDT 2002
#    Added avtDatasetCollection.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Aug 27 15:07:03 PDT 2002
#    Removed all file formats and the SAF database so that they may
#    be placed in database plugins instead.  Removed database-type specific
#    includes and libraries.
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed Dec  4 08:14:40 PST 2002
#    Add avtSILGenerator.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jan  6 10:24:00 PST 2003
#    Added more clearcase targets to prevent it from shadowing the 
#    auto-generated source with derived objects.
#
#    Hank Childs, Fri Mar 14 17:30:23 PST 2003
#    Add avtFileFormatInterface.
#
#    Hank Childs, Fri Apr  4 15:11:01 PST 2003 
#    Add avtMTMDFileFormatInterface, avtMTMDFileFormat.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Aug 20 09:53:52 PDT 2003
#    I moved MIR into its own library.
#
#    Akira Haddox, Wed Aug 20 11:22:47 PDT 2003

#    Added more libraries to make prebinding possible on the Mac.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jul  7 12:12:52 PDT 2004
#    I changed _ser.o to simply be .o.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Jan 5 09:25:20 PDT 2005
#    Added -lexpr for MacOS X.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Apr 29 12:07:54 PDT 2005
#    Moved -lmir to -lmir_ser, -lmir_par for parallel MacOS X build.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Jan 26 15:38:25 PST 2006
#    Added -lbz2 for Mac.
