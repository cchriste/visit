//  Class: avtSimilarityTransformFilter
//
//  Purpose:
//      A filter that performs transformations where the matrix is a 
//      similarity matrix.  This allows for rotations, translation, and
//      scaling.
//
//  Programmer: Jeremy Meredith
//  Creation:   September 24, 2001
//
//  Modifications:
//
//    Kathleen Bonnell, Wed Nov 28 16:59:53 PST 2001
//    Added RefashionDataObjectInfo, PerformRestriction.
//
//    Hank Childs, Tue Mar  5 16:05:25 PST 2002
//    Removed RefashionDataObjectInfo, since what is was doing is also
//    applicable to the base class, so I pushed the logic into it.
//
//    Kathleen Bonnell, Thu Apr 10 11:07:48 PDT 2003 
//    Store inverse matrix for possible use later in the pipeline. 
//    Added PostExecute method.
//    
//    Hank Childs, Mon Jun 30 15:03:32 PDT 2003
//    Made this filter no longer be a streamer.  Renamed with Similarity.
//    Also moved to components directory.
