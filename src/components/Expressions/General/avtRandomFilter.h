//  Class: avtRandomFilter
//
//  Purpose:
//      Creates a random number at each point.  Mostly used for odd effects in
//      movie-making.
//          
//  Programmer: Hank Childs
//  Creation:   March 7, 2003
//
//  Modifications:
//
//    Hank Childs, Thu Feb  5 17:11:06 PST 2004
//    Moved inlined constructor and destructor definitions to .C files
//    because certain compilers have problems with them.
//
//    Hank Childs, Mon Jul 10 09:03:13 PDT 2006
//    Added PreExecute.
//
//    Hank Childs, Thu Aug 24 11:24:41 PDT 2006
//    Remove PreExecute, since it was not successfully accomplishing its
//    purpose (setting up the seed for the random number generator in a
//    reproducible way).
