//  Class: avtBinaryMultiplyFilter
//
//  Purpose:
//      A filter that calculates the product of its two inputs
//
//  Programmer: Sean Ahern
//  Creation:   Thu Jun 27 11:15:41 PDT 2002
//
//  Modifications:
//
//    Hank Childs, Thu Aug 14 13:40:20 PDT 2003
//    Tell the output that we have one component if we are doing a dot product.
//
//    Hank Childs, Thu Feb  5 17:11:06 PST 2004
//    Moved inlined constructor and destructor definitions to .C files
//    because certain compilers have problems with them.
