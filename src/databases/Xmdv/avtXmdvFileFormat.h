//  Class: avtXmdvFileFormat
//
//  Purpose:
//      Reads in Xmdv files as a plugin to VisIt.  Xmdv is a tools that
//      uses parallel coordinates to allow users to infer relations between
//      quantities.  The tool has a homegrown format that uses the extension
//      ".okc" to store parallel coordinates data.  This reader is useful
//      in VisIt for two reasons.  (1) It allows us to test "array" data that
//      comes directly from a file (as opposed to an expression).  (2) Since
//      the format is so simple, OKC files are a good way to export data from
//      VisIt into other tools.
