// Method: PDB_CreateFileFormatInterface
//
// Purpose: 
//   Opens the first PDB file in the list and attempts to use the various file
//   formats to create a file format interface.
//
// Arguments:
//   list   : The list of filenames.
//   nList  : The number of filenames in the list.
//   nBlock : The number of files in a timestep.
//
// Returns:    A file format interface or 0 if no file format interface
//             was created.
//
