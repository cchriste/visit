Well, better late than never.  Introducing a changelog for the paraDIS library. 

2013-04-25: version 2.3
        Implemented MetaArm visualization, including subsetting by some new variables in the meshes.  Using enumerated scalars now for better subset operations.  
        We now have metaarm visualization.  
        Added several new variables, some having to do with meta-arms, cleaned up variable naming convention, and converted some into enumerated scalars to allow subset operations to work. 
        Added the ability to write out so-called tagfiles, which are simply a copy of the original data with certain values replaced by "8" when a node is in a LOOP metaarm.
