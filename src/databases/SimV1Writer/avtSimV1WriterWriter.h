// Class: avtSimV1WriterWriter
//
// Purpose:
//   Writer interface that translates requests to write into data transfers
//   back to the simulation. This lets the simulation provide callbacks that
//   let it accept data back from VisIt.
//
// Notes:      
//
// Programmer: Brad Whitlock
// Creation:   Mon Oct 30 14:22:32 PST 2006
//
// Modifications:
//    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Mar 27 11:39:24 EDT 2007
//    Added numblocks to the OpenFile method, and save off the actual
//    encountered mesh types, because we cannot trust the metadata.
//
