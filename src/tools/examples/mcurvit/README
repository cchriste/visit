Mcurvit is a sample embedded viewer application that displays a multi curve
plot of 2d rectilinear data.  It also applies an index select operator to
control the range of data from the mesh that is displayed.  It can be run
in a GUI mode or a batch CLI mode.

When running mcurvit, you must first set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that it can
find the visit libraries. You can do that with the following command.

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ../../lib

You must also have a saved configuration with the MultiCurve plot enabled,
since by default it is not enabled.  If you forget to do that, mcurvit will
crash.

To run it in GUI mode do the following:

1) ./mcurvit

2) Open a file with a 2d rectlinear mesh.  A good choice would be
   /usr/gapps/visit/data/rect2d.silo.

This will cause mcurvit to display a MultiCurve plot of the first variable
in the file.  At this point you can change the variable (u and v are
better choices for variables than t if you are visualizing  rect2d.silo),
change the index select range, change the MultiCurve plot attributes, and
change appearance attributes.

You can also save the currently displayed image as a PNG file.

To run it in batch CLI mode do the following:

1) ./mcurvit -G -f inFile /usr/gapps/visit/data/rect2d.silo

This will create two PNG images from the file rect2d.silo.  Mcurvit will
exit after executing the batch file.  The commands in the file inFile are
pretty much it as far as commands that it understands are concerned.
