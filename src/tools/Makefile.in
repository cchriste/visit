#    Removed 'silex' from SUBDIRS variable but kept actual silex directory
#    around for a while. This essentially removes it from builds but makes
#    it possible for people to easily build it if for some reasone they
#    still want to build this version. In fact, they should really be using
#    the silex in Silo distro as that has been kept up to date with various
#    changes to Silo library.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Wed Mar  4 17:54:09 PST 2009
#    Enabled a dbio-only build
