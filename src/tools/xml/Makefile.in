#  Modifications:
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Nov 13 11:47:16 PST 2001
#    Made it use a static Qt library if available.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 12 16:29:01 PDT 2002
#    Added the root include directory so we can include visit-config.h.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jul 18 11:53:59 PDT 2002
#    Quick hack to allow parallel builds in this directory.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Aug 8 17:50:43 PST 2002
#    I added xml2java.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Tue Sep  3 15:57:14 PDT 2002
#    We were missing some of the default rules.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Dec 16 11:22:01 PDT 2003
#    Added xml2projectfile target though we don't build it by default since
#    it generates project files for Windows.
# 
#    Eric Brugger, Mon Jul 26 14:20:50 PDT 2004
#    Added -I../../include/visit to pick up visitstream.h.
