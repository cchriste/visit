// ****************************************************************************
// Class: CumulativeQueryNamedSelectionExtension
//
// Purpose:
//   This class implements cumulative query named selections as an extension
//   to named selections.
//
// Notes:      This class is implemented in the engine instead of in AVT because
//             putting it in AVT would cause some library tangling since this
//             class uses some avt filters under the hood.
//
// Programmer: Brad Whitlock
// Creation:   Mon Dec 13 15:56:56 PST 2010
//
// Modifications:
//   Brad Whitlock, Tue Sep  6 15:27:34 PDT 2011
//   I changed the API so we could add caching support that lets setting
//   query attributes sometimes bypass filter execution.
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Fri Oct 28 11:48:05 PDT 2011
//   Change the API.
