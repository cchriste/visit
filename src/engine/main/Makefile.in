# Modifications:
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Aug  4 16:42:44 PDT 2000

#
#    Hank Childs, Mon Oct  8 17:23:37 PDT 2001

#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Thu Apr 29 16:54:44 PDT 2004 
#    Added engineparstate_par to PARLIBS. 
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jul  7 12:12:52 PDT 2004
#    I changed _ser.o to simply be .o.
#

#    Added the engine wrapper library.
#
