#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Aug  4 16:42:44 PDT 2000
#    Changed source listing to use SRC=$(OBJ:.o=.C).  This allows parsing
#    of this Makefile.in for object files inside configure.
#    Cleaned up some stuff, too.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Sep 21 22:38:15 PDT 2000
#    Turned these objects into the engineparstate library.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu May 10 14:02:09 PDT 2001
#    Made it create a shared library.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 20 14:15:51 PDT 2001
#    Added @PX@ to libparstate.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul 23 00:41:31 PDT 2001
#    Added _par or _ser extension to library name.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 10:35:09 PDT 2001
#    Changed library building: the LIB targets has no extension, and
#    either LIBSINGLETARGETS or LIBMULTITARGETS must be included
#    in addition to TARGETS depending on whether the library is build
#    from object files in one directory or multiple subdirectories.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jan 16 09:54:48 PST 2002
#    Make this library build serial and parallel versions concurrently.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 12 14:34:44 PDT 2002
#    Unified include directories.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Apr 23 09:03:45 PDT 2004
#    Added more libraries to get prebinding working on MacOS X.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jul  7 12:12:52 PDT 2004
#    I changed _ser.o to simply be .o.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Jul 14 16:22:03 PST 2005
#    Added a few more libs for parallel on MacOS X.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Jan 30 10:28:55 PDT 2006
#    Added MacOS X stuff.
#
#    Thomas R. Treadway, Wed Feb  7 17:53:04 PST 2007
#    Added $(GLEW_LIBS) for MacOS X.
