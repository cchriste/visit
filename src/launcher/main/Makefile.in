# Modifications:
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu May 24 11:24:15 EDT 2007
#    Added SocketBridge.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Jun 29 09:27:56 PDT 2007
#    Removed the setting of the DISTRIB variable.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Nov 21 10:12:06 PST 2007
#    Added testvcl program.
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed May  6 08:41:19 PDT 2009
#    Remove reference to $INCLUDE, which is not a variable that our configure
#    script uses.  It was working in most places, because it was not defined,
#    but TACC's machines define INCLUDE as an environment variable.
#
#    Hank Childs, Tue Nov 10 05:47:15 PST 2009
#    Add path for linking (-L../../lib).
