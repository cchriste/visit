# This is a subversion hook script meant to notice when a user changes a state
# object, and warn them to update the corresponding objects.  It takes two
# arguments: the path to the repository, and a transaction identifier -- in
# that order.
# The script is intended to be installed as `post-commit' hook.  In that
# situation, it will print a message to the user's terminal (if appropriate).
# If you install it as a `pre-commit' hook, it would abort the transaction.
