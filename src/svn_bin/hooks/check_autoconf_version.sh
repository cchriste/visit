# Purpose: Check that configure.in/configure always get updated together.
#          Also, check that correct version of autoconf was used to
#          generate configure.

#   Added a bypass/allow for modifying configure if you've modified any m4
#   files.  Also, 's/\t/\ \ \ \ /g'
#

#   Fixed typo in logic involving || for $m4_file

#   Fixed typo in logic involving && for $m4_file

#   Obtain list of changed files via FLIST ($3) argument and loop
#   over them via 'read' sh builtin method.
#
#   Mark C. Miller, Tue Dec  9 23:08:23 PST 2008
#   Adjusted file loop to deal with fact that FLIST file now contains
#   both status chars and filename. Replaced ${<VARNAME>} command refs
#   with just the commands themselves.
#
#   Mark C. Miller, Tue Mar 24 22:02:44 PDT 2009
#   Changed logic to simply record the configure file in one variable
#   and all other files that serve as input to configure in another
#   variable.
