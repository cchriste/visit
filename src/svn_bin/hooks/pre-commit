# VisIt pre-commit hook script.
#
# Subversion requires a specific name for hook scripts.  To avoid getting us in
# a situation where we want to add a pre-commit script, but we've already
# implemented one, this script is a `meta-script' which simply runs others.  To
# add a new hook script, you should add a `runhook' line before the `exit 0' at
# the bottom of this file.  The argument to runhook is a script which must
# reside in the `hooks' directory of our repository.
# All pre-commit scripts take REPOSITORY_PATH and TRANSACTION_ID as arguments,
# in that order.  See the subversion redbook for more information.
