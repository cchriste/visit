#  Use glob to find all host profiles & ini files we want to install

#  Support installation of global host profiles on "make install". Set
#  VISIT_INSTALL_PROFILES_TO_HOSTS to "nersc", "ornl" etc. to create
#  a global "hosts" directory in the VisIt install and copy over the
#  corresponding host profiles.
