Modifications to CGNS
======================

I modified the CGNS header file (cgnslib.h) so it supports automatic creation
of an import library when CGNS is built as a DLL on win32 platforms. An import
library is required to link applications against a library that was built as
a DLL. My change adds the macro "CGNS_API" to the exported function prototypes.
