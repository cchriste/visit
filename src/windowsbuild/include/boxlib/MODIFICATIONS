Modifications to Boxlib
========================

I modified several Boxlib header files so they export their symbols to allow
Boxlib to be built as a DLL on win32 platforms. To to this, I've added a new
header file called: boxlib_exports.h that contains the definition for the new
BOXLIB_API macro, which is responsible for exporting symbols. I've added
BOXLIB_API to class definitions that were used by VisIt. Finally, I added some
methods in FArrayBox.H that override base class methods of BaseFab<Real>. This
change does not cause any behavior alterations in Boxlib but does permit VisIt
to link against Boxlib built as a DLL.
