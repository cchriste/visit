                       Installation instructions for VisIt
                      =====================================

This document contains instructions for installing VisIt on Windows, MacOS X,
and Unix systems.  The Windows and MacOS X installation instructions are first,
followed by the Unix installation instructions.

* Note that VisIt can be installed in 2 different ways on MacOS X: as an 
  application bundle and as a gzipped tar file, as on Unix installations.


Windows:
========

1.  Copy the visit2.5.2.exe or visit2.5.2_x64.exe installer program to your desktop.

2.  Double click on the installer program icon to run the installer.

3.  Follow the directions provided by the installer.


MacOS X (application bundle):
==============================

Downloads:
* VisIt-2.5.2-i386-installer.dmg    : 32-bit Mac
* VisIt-2.5.2-x86_64-installer.dmg  : 64-bit Mac and runs on Mac 10.6 or later

1. Download the appropriate file and copy it to the desktop.

2. Double click on the file to open it. This will cause MacOS to mount the
   disk image and open it in Finder.

3. Once the disk image is open in Finder, copy the VisIt application to
   the desktop.

4. Eject the disk image in Finder.

5. Double click on the VisIt application to run VisIt.


Unix and MacOS X (gzipped tar file):
=====================================

1.  Run the visit-install script to install visit.  If you have built your
    own visit binary distribution, you can find the visit-install script
    in the svn_bin directory.  The visit-install script can create a new
    distribution directory or update an existing distribution.  This is
    handled automatically.

        chmod 755 visit-install2_5_2
        ./visit-install2_5_2 "version" "platform" "directory"

    where

        "version" will be 2.5.2 for the current distribution.

        "platform" will be one of the following:  linux-rhel5, linux-rhel6,
        linux-x86_64-ubuntu11, linux-x86_64, linux-x86_64-euclid, darwin-i386
        or darwin-x86_64 depending on the machine.  The one you use should
        match the name of the accompanying distribution file.

        "directory" is the directory you wish to install visit into.
        If the directory doesn't exist the script will create it.

    For example

        chmod 755 visit-install2_5_2
        ./visit-install2_5_2 2.5.2 linux-rhel5 /usr/local/visit

    will install the linux-rhel5, 2.5.2 version of visit in the directory
    "/usr/local/visit".  Note that you will need to have the file
    "visit2_5_2.linux-rhel5.tar.gz" present in the current directory for this
    to function properly.  You can install multiple binaries into the
    same directory.  For example, you could then execute

        chmod 755 visit-install2_5_2
        ./visit-install2_5_2 2.5.2 linux-x86_64 /usr/local/visit

    to add a linux x86_64, 2.5.2 version of visit to the same directory.

2.  Add the bin directory below the installation directory
    (/usr/local/visit/bin in our example) to each user's search path.
    The best way to do this is to add it to the user's .cshrc file.
    The bin directory contains the visit script which starts VisIt.
    It can be run on many machines.  The script determines the type of
    machine it is running on and starts the appropriate executable.
    If visit were installed in the directory "/usr/local/visit",
    then the following commands would set your search path
    appropriately.

        cd
        echo "set path = ($path /usr/local/visit/bin)" >> .cshrc

    This completes the installation process for VisIt.

3.  If you are installing VisIt on a Linux system with an NVidia graphics
    card, we recommend using the latest driver.
