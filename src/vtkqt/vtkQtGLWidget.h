class vtkQtRenderWindowInteractor;

// ****************************************************************************
// Class: vtkQtGLWidget
//
// Purpose:
//   This class extends the Qt OpenGL widget to include custom methods that
//   allow it to work with VTK while also allowing the widget to be contained
//   within a QMainWindow so we can have builtin toolbar support.
//
// Notes:      Mostly I had to subclass QGLWidget so that the proper
//             initializeGL method would be called.
//
// Programmer: Brad Whitlock
// Creation:   Mon Jan 27 14:40:19 PST 2003
//
// Modifications:
//   Brad Whitlock, Mon Apr 7 14:43:12 PST 2003
//   I removed the minimumSizeHint method.
