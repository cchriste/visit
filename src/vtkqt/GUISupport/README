These classes were borrowed from VTK's GUISupport library so we can have a
VTK/Qt widget that we don't have to maintain.

We would have used the GUISupport directly from VTK but building VTK with Qt
support currently introduces a Qt dependency into the vtkRendering library. We
are not willing to introduce that dependency since it adds Qt to our compute 
engine.


Changes:
=========
1. I made QVTKWin32Header.h define QVTK_EXPORT in a way that will hide the
   VTK widget code from being made public in the vtkqt shared library.

Bugs fixed:
============
1. When QVTKWidget2 gets a mouse event, it sends it to QVTKInteractorAdaptor
   to turn it into a command for a vtkRenderWindowInteractor. It uses 
   iren->SetEventInformationFlipY which in turn wants the window size to flip
   the Y value. QVTKWidget2 was sending a QResizeEvent to the interactor
   adaptor that had size(0,0) and oldSize(w,h). The interactor adaptor used
   the size value to set the size of the interactor, causing negative values
   to be used for the pixel coordinates of the event. I changed it so it passes
   size(w,h) for the resize event and now the interactor size gets set 
   properly.
