These classes were borrowed from VTK's GUISupport library so we can have a
VTK/Qt widget that we don't have to maintain.

We would have used the GUISupport directly from VTK but building VTK with Qt
support currently introduces a Qt dependency into the vtkRendering library. We
are not willing to introduce that dependency since it adds Qt to our compute 
engine.


Changes:
=========
1. I made QVTKWin32Header.h define QVTK_EXPORT in a way that will hide the
   VTK widget code from being made public in the vtkqt shared library.

Bugs fixed:
============
1. When QVTKWidget2 gets a mouse event, it sends it to QVTKInteractorAdaptor
   to turn it into a command for a vtkRenderWindowInteractor. It uses 
   iren->SetEventInformationFlipY which in turn wants the window size to flip
   the Y value. QVTKWidget2 was sending a QResizeEvent to the interactor
   adaptor that had size(0,0) and oldSize(w,h). The interactor adaptor used
   the size value to set the size of the interactor, causing negative values
   to be used for the pixel coordinates of the event. I changed it so it passes
   size(w,h) for the resize event and now the interactor size gets set 
   properly.

2. I copied all new files from VTK 5.10 to fix a bug that caused an offscreen
   buffer to be leaked when changing actors or interacting with the plots in
   the vis window. This ultimately caused the viewer to blow up from lack of
   memory. In order to do this, I had to make some changes to QVTKWidget2 since
   VTK 5.8's vtkOpenGLRenderWindow does not separate OpenGLInit() into
   2 separate methods as VTK 5.10 does. This means that when the widget wanted
   to call OpenGLInitContext(), I instead made it call OpenGLInit(). When we
   only need to set the state, I make a surrogate method QVTKWidget2::OpenGLInitState()
   that does what the render window would have otherwise done in VTK 5.10. This
   change seems to prevent a modified flag from causing a buffer to get 
   reallocated and leaked. I tried this approach after seeing similar symptoms
   at http://vtk.1045678.n5.nabble.com/QVTKWidget2-memory-leak-td5513981.html.
   When we upgrade VTK to 5.10 or 6.0, we can overwrite the GUISupport classes
   here since they will have the fixes I'm making.
