//  Method: disableGLHiDPI
//
//  Purpose:
//    Disable using High DPI (retina display) which creates an OpenGL backing
//    surface with a resolution greater than 1 pixel per point. The caller will
//    need to ensure that Qt is using Cocoa since win_id can be a pointer to 
//    an HIViewRef (Carbon) or NSView (Cocoa).

//
//  Arguments:
//    win_id : window system identifier. The type depends on the framework
//             Qt was linked against. If Qt is using Carbon, win_id is 
//             actually an HIViewRef. If Qt is using Cocoa, win_id is a pointer
//             to an NSView.
