#  Modifications:
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Jun  5 17:38:34 EDT 2007
#    Renamed the main object files to a more standard SEROBJ, PAROBJ, and FOBJ
#    to play better with automatic dependencies.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Nov  2 18:28:33 EDT 2007
#    Put the binary in the real bin dir to play better with OS X.  Also,
#    set export-dynamic based on a configure-detected value, since not all
#    platforms support or need it.
