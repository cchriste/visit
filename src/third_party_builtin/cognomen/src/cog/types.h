/*
 * Modifications:
 *   Mark C. Miller, Thu Jul  2 12:14:01 PDT 2009
 *   Added names for anon. typedefs and structs. Added conditional
 *   compilation of name for inner-struct of _cog_set so it would
 *   work with C++ or C compiler
 *
 *   Mark C. Miller, Thu Jul  2 18:25:22 PDT 2009
 *   Removed conditional compilation of name for inner struct of
 *   _cog_set and separated definition of the inner struct from
 *   declaration of the member, 'set'.  When both the definition of
 *   the struct and declaration of 'set' were combined gcc-3.2.3 was
 *   complaining of a missing semicolon.
