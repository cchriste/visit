(This is a hacked up version specifically for VisIt.)

Cognomen is a library for node identification.

The ostensible purpose is to identify which processes are running on the same
node in a distributed system.  This information might be useful for optimizing
certain algorithms (e.g. doing local-group communication before remote
communication), or for resource acquisition.

Cognomen is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License.  The full
text of this license should have been included in a file 'COPYING.LESSER'
within the distribution medium.  Since this is given in terms of additional
clauses on top of the GNU GPL, the full text of the GPL is given in the file
'COPYING'.
