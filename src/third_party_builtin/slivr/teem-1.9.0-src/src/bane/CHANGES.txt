Changes from 1.5beta0 ---------------------------------------------

- BUG FIX (inc.c): the min and max increments use to nibble at the
histogram in percentile-based inclusion were set wrong, meaning that
only baneRangeFloat ranges were computed correctly.
- API NEW (gkms*.c): all the smarts of the "gkms" program are now in
the bane library, just like unrrdu commands
