Changes from 1.5beta0 -----------------------------------------------

- INTERFACE CHANGE (unu.c): when you type "unu bcmd" where bcmd is not a
recognized command, you don't get the whole unu command listing
- INTERFACE CHANGE (gkms.c): completely re-written, now based on hest.
All the functionality should still be there, and then some.
