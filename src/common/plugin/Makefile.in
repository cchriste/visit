#    I split the viewer and engine parts of the plugin manager.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Thu Mar 29 14:24:39 PST 2001
#    I corrected an error with "make clean" where not all the object files
#    were getting cleaned up.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu May 10 14:02:09 PDT 2001

#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 10:36:54 PDT 2001
#    Changed library building: the LIB targets has no extension, and
#    either LIBSINGLETARGETS or LIBMULTITARGETS must be included
#    in addition to TARGETS depending on whether the library is build
#    from object files in one directory or multiple subdirectories.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jan 16 09:47:02 PST 2002
#    This now has only one version, not a serial and parallel version.
