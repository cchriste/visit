//  Class: StackTimer
//
//  Purpose:
//      Simplified mechanism for timing blocks of code.  Create a StackTimer on
//      the stack and it will record timing information when it goes out of
//      scope.  For example:
//
//         if(doLongComplicatedTask) {
//             StackTimer task_identifier("my task");
//             this->Function();
//         }
//
//      For short blocks, it may be easier to use the macro:
//
//         TimedCodeBlock("my task", this->Function());
//
//  Programmer: Tom Fogal
//  Creation:   July 2, 2007
//
//  Modifications:
//    Kathleen Bonnell, Fri Jun 20 08:15:27 PDT 2008
//    Moved constructor and destructor to 'C' file, in order for this class'
//    methods to be available on windows platform.
//
//    Tom Fogal, Mon Aug 25 09:54:55 EDT 2008
//    Made a std::string-based constructor.
