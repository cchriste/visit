//  Class: OnionPeel
//
//  Purpose:
//      Takes in an ucd mesh and calculates the onion peel information.
//
//  Data Members:
//      domain      -  The domain to which the connectivity information 
//                     corresponds.
//      meshName    -  The name of the mesh.
//      list        -  The list of which zones correspond to which nodes.
//                     This is an array of size [nnodes]x[zones for node i],
//                     but is implemented as a one-dimensional array.
//      offset      -  The offsets into list that allow the two-dimensional
//                     array (list) to be implemented as a one-dimensional 
//                     array.  This is an array of size nnodes.
//      nnodes      -  The number of nodes for this mesh in this domain.
