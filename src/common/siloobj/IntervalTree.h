//  Class: IntervalTree
// 
//  Purpose:
//      Keeps an interval tree.
//
//  Data Members:
//      nNodes         The number of nodes in the tree.
//      nDomains       The number of domains in the problem.  This is also the
//                     number of leaf nodes in the tree.
//      nDims          The dimension of the values of the variable. 
//      nodeExtents    The minimum and maximum bounds for all node that 
//                     are covered by this node.  An array of size nNodes by
//                     nDims*2.  Note the nodeExtents is used to store the 
//                     domain values until the tree is constructed.  The
//                     array is kept as 1-dimensional to prevent excessive 
//                     'new's and to allow for MPI calls.
//      nodeIDs        A list that will convert a node number for the interval
//                     tree back to its original domain number.  An array of 
//                     size nNodes.
//      vectorSize     The size of the vector associated with one domain.  This
//                     should be 2*nDims.
