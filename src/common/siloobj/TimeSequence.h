//  Class: TimeSequence
//
//  Purpose:
//      Keeps all information about the time sequence.
//      This object also contains information about the fields associated
//      with each state.
// 
//  Data Members:
//      nStates            -  The number of times states in the sequence.
//      times              -  The time associated with each state.  The time 
//                            need to be organized in a monotonically 
//                            increasing fashion.  The size of this array will 
//                            be nStates.
//      cycles             -  The cycle associated with each state.  The 
//                            cycles need to be organized in a monotonically 
//                            increasing fashion.  The size of this array will 
//                            be nStates.
//      states             -  The name of the file containing the fields for 
//                            each state. The size of this array wil be 
//                            nStates.
//      nFields            -  The number of fields associated with each state.
//      fieldNames         -  The name of each field in a state.  The size of
//                            this array will be nFields.
//      fieldTypes         -  The type of each field in a state.  The size of
//                            this array will be nFields.
//      fieldDimension     -  The dimension of each field in the state.  The
//                            size of this array will be nFields.
//      fieldIntervalTree  -  The name of the interval tree of each field in
//                            the state.  The size of this array will be 
//                            nFields.
