 * Purpose: Converts an integer on the host platform to an integer

 * Programmer: Brad Whitlock
 * Date:       Tue May 9 10:51:14 PDT 2000
 *
 * Input Arguments:
 *     val : The integer value to be converted.
 *     dest_format : The destination platform's format. B32, B64, L32, L64.
 * Input / Output Arguments:
 *     buf : The buffer to hold the resulting bytes.
