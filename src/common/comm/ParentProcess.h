class Connection;

// ****************************************************************************
// Class: ParentProcess
//
// Purpose:
//   This class sets up communication with a parent process. It first
//   reads in the command line arguments that tell about the process
//   that launched it, then it sets up connections with that process.
//
// Notes:      
//
// Programmer: Brad Whitlock
// Creation:   Fri Jul 21 14:59:26 PST 2000
//
// Modifications:
//   Jeremy Meredith, Tue Aug  8 13:49:42 PDT 2000
//   Changed it to allow more than one read/write socket.   
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Thu Apr 26 15:57:46 PST 2001
//   Added version stuff.
// 
//   Jeremy Meredith, Fri Apr 27 15:28:42 PDT 2001
//   Added fail bit.
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Thu Apr 11 15:42:42 PST 2002
//   Added a GetUserName method.
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Mon Mar 25 15:11:28 PST 2002
//   Made it use regular connections.
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Mon Dec 16 14:27:22 PST 2002
//   Added a security key.
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Tue Jul 29 10:54:29 PDT 2003
//   Added numRead and numWrite to the Connect method so we know how many
//   connections to create without having to pass the numbers on the command
//   line.
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Wed Jan 11 17:00:35 PST 2006
//   Added localUserName.
//
//   Jeremy Meredith, Wed Apr 30 12:26:25 EDT 2008
//   Added apparent host name (tries to resolve localhost into a real name).
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Tue Apr 14 15:13:20 PDT 2009
//   I made Connect return bool as to whether any connections were created
//   since it is possible to call Connect and not create any connections.
