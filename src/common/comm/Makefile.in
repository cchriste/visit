# Modifications:
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Aug  4 16:42:44 PDT 2000
#    Changed source listing to use SRC=$(OBJ:.o=.C).  This allows parsing
#    of this Makefile.in for object files inside configure.
#    Cleaned up some stuff, too.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Aug 29 12:25:02 PDT 2000
#    Added SocketConnection to the library.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Nov 17 16:24:27 PST 2000
#    Moved the files from common/misc/ into this directory.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Nov 20 16:39:30 PST 2000
#    Added ExistingRemoteProcess to the library.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Apr 25 11:57:46 PDT 2001
#    Added CommunicationHeader to the library.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu May 10 14:02:09 PDT 2001
#    Made it create a shared library.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 10:36:59 PDT 2001
#    Changed library building: the LIB targets has no extension, and
#    either LIBSINGLETARGETS or LIBMULTITARGETS must be included
#    in addition to TARGETS depending on whether the library is build
#    from object files in one directory or multiple subdirectories.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Mar 26 12:05:24 PDT 2002
#    Added ConnectionGroup.
#
#    Hank Childs, Thu May  2 14:25:34 PDT 2002
#    Removed non-existent headers.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 12 14:37:51 PDT 2002
#    Unified include directories.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Sep 27 11:32:59 PDT 2002
#    Added CancelledConnectException.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Dec 13 11:52:33 PDT 2002
#    I added PTHREAD_CXXFLAGS to the CXXFLAGS.
#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Wed Feb 26 10:56:19 PST 2003  
#    Added NoEngineException. 
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Mar 3 08:31:18 PDT 2003
#    I moved NoEngineException to viewer/main.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Apr 2 10:45:46 PDT 2003
#    I added a test program called testcomm.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed May 21 14:37:28 PST 2003
#    I added PipeConnection.
