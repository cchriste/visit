 *
 * Purpose: Converts a float on the host platform to a float on the
 *          destination platform and writes the resulting bytes into
 *          buf. The size of the converted array is returned.
 *
 * Programmer: Brad Whitlock
 * Date:       Tue May 9 10:51:14 PDT 2000
 *
 * Input Arguments:
 *     val : The float value to be converted.
 *     dest_format : The destination platform's format. B32, L32.
 * Input / Output Arguments:
 *     buf : The buffer to hold the resulting bytes.
