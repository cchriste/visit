class Subject;

// *******************************************************************
// Class: SimpleObserver
//
// Purpose:
//   Defines an interface for the observer in the observer design
//   pattern. See Design Patterns p.293
//
// Notes:      This is an abstract base class. Note that the subject
//   that actually changed is passed to the Update method. This is so
//   we can support having observers that watch more than one subject.
//
// Programmer: Brad Whitlock

// Modifications:
//   Brad Whitlock, Thu Aug 31 15:18:18 PST 2000
//   Added SubjectRemoved.
