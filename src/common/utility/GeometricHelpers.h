//
//  Purpose:
//    So far, this is just a nice place to store the geometry for
//    a geodesic sphere tesselated as a few different levels, since
//    calculating that on the fly isn't cheap.  Furthermore, I'm adding
//    an expression and operator which must agree on the same geometry,
//    including the same ordering, so it must be some place common....
