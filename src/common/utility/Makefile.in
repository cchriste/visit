#    Made it create a shared library.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 27 13:50:06 PDT 2001
#    Made it remove libutility on a make clean.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 10:36:33 PDT 2001
#    Changed library building: the LIB targets has no extension, and
#    either LIBSINGLETARGETS or LIBMULTITARGETS must be included
#    in addition to TARGETS depending on whether the library is build
#    from object files in one directory or multiple subdirectories.
#
#    Hank Childs, Mon Sep 17 10:44:49 PDT 2001
#    Added array_ref_ptr.h
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Feb 14 15:04:07 PST 2002
#    Split part of Utility into VTKUtility
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Aug 27 14:12:37 PDT 2002
#    Removed VTKUtility entirely.  Its functionality is now split between
#    the SiloDump operator plugin or the Silo database plugin.
#
#    Hank Childs, Tue Sep 24 09:44:49 PDT 2002
#    Remove ref_ptr.C, add void_ref_ptr.C
