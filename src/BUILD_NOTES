                         ==============================

VisIt relies on several external libraries which must be built and installed
prior to building VisIt.  This document provides detailed step by step
instructions for building VisIt and each of the dependent libraries.  The
instructions have been designed so that you can cut and paste most of the
commands needed to build the libraries and VisIt from this file into your
shell prompt.

The public version of VisIt has been built with the above listed versions
of the libraries, so it is known to work properly with those versions.  For
all the packages except VTK and Qt, you can probably use newer versions of the
packages and VisIt should work properly.  For Mesa, you must build a mangled
version of Mesa.  The distribution provided has already been set up to build
a mangled version so no additional work is required if you use it.  For VTK,
you must use the March 23, 2004 distribution provided. The version of Qt
used to build VisIt must be greater than or equal to 2.3.0. VisIt is also
compatible with Qt versions 3.0.2 or later.

VisIt also contains many database readers which are also built on external
libraries.  If you want to make use of these readers you will also need to
build and install those libraries prior to building VisIt.

Most of the third party libraries necessary to build VisIt are available for
download from ftp://ftp.llnl.gov/pub/visit/3rd_party.  It is suggested that
you start there and then go to the "For More Information" web sites for
any remaining libraries.


Building VisIt
===============

VisIt can currently be built on aix, irix, mac os x, linux, solaris, tru64
and windows operating systems.  The following instructions only apply to
building VisIt on Unix systems and does not apply to Mac OS X or Windows.

We currently build VisIt using the following compilers on the following
operating systems.  It is suggested that you use the same compilers.


   Operating System                        Compiler
   ================                        ========
   AIX 5.1                                 g++ 3.1 or xlc
   IRIX64 6.5                              MIPSpro 7.41
   Redhad Enterprise Linux 3 (x86)         g++ 3.2.3
   Redhad Enterprise Linux 4 (x86, ia64)   g++ 3.2.3 or icc 9.0
   Redhad Enterprise Linux 4 (x86_64)      g++ 3.4.4
   Solaris 7                               g++ 3.2
   Tru64 5.1                               g++ 3.3.3

The following compilers will *NOT* work with VisIt.  They will either not
compile VisIt or will generate bad code.

   Operating System                        Compiler
   ================                        ========
   AIX 5.1                                 g++ 3.2.3 -> 3.3.3

It is essential that you build all the dependent packages and VisIt using
the same c++ compiler or you will encounter linking problems because different
compilers or different versions of the same compiler may use different name
mangling schemes.

If you want to specify the compiler for a particular package that is
using configure, the typical way to do so is by setting the CC and CXX
environment variables.  This is done as follows:

   setenv CC "your C compiler"
   setenv CXX "your C++ compiler"

where some common values for CC and CXX are:

    Operating System      CC               CXX
    ================      ========         ======     
    Various               gcc              g++
    Linux (x86, ia64)     icc              icpc
    AIX                   xlc              xlC
    IRIX64 6.5            cc               CC

If you are using gmake or are building on an SGI and your machine has
multiple CPUs, you may speed up the build process for many of the products
by doing a parallel make.  For gmake, the command would be

   make -j "# of processors"

and for an SGI the command would be

   env PARALLEL="# of processors" make -P

Lets go ahead and build VisIt.  Start off by creating a directory to hold
VisIt and the installed versions of each of the dependent libraries.

mkdir visit
setenv VISITDIR `pwd`/visit

Typically a single directory will hold the binaries and libraries for
multiple machine architectures.  Lets create an environment variable to
hold the name of the architecture specific directory.  Some examples
include:

setenv VISITARCH aix_5_gcc_3.1
setenv VISITARCH aix_5_xlc_64
setenv VISITARCH altix_gcc_3.3.3
setenv VISITARCH chaos_3_ia64_elan4_gcc_3.2.3
setenv VISITARCH chaos_3_x86_64_ib_gcc_3.4.4
setenv VISITARCH chaos_3_x86_elan3_gcc_3.2.3
setenv VISITARCH chaos_3_x86_elan3_icc_9.0
setenv VISITARCH irix64_cc_7.3.1.2_64
setenv VISITARCH irix64_cc_7.41_64
setenv VISITARCH linux_rhel3_gcc_3.2.3
setenv VISITARCH linux_redhat7_gcc_3.2.3
setenv VISITARCH solaris_gcc_2.95.2
setenv VISITARCH solaris_gcc_3.2
setenv VISITARCH tru64_5_gcc_3.3.3

Now build each of the dependent libraries followed by VisIt.


Mesa
=====

Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to that of
OpenGL.  It is used for performing off-screen rendering.

#
# Build Mesa
#
gunzip Mesa-5.0-mangled.tar.gz
tar xf Mesa-5.0-mangled.tar
cd Mesa-5.0

#
# Mesa causes the engine to crash when built with icc 9.0 in the routine
# mesa_test_os_sse_exception_support, so don't use it.  The gcc version
# is compatible with icc 9.0, so you may build Mesa with it and the rest
# of VisIt with icc 9.0.
#
# To build Mesa, one of the following targets should probably be used.  The
# complete list of targets is available by typing "make" in the Mesa-5.0
# directory.
#
#  make aix                  for IBM RS/6000
#  make darwin               for Macintosh systems running MacOS X
#  make irix6-n32-dso        for SGI systems with IRIX 6.x, make n32-bit DSOs
#  make irix6-64-dso         for SGI systems with IRIX 6.x, make 64-bit DSOs
#  make linux                for Linux systems, make shared .so libs
#  make linux-alpha          for Linux on Alpha systems
#  make linux-icc            for Linux systems using icc, make shared .so libs
#  make osf1-sl              for DEC Alpha systems with OSF/1, make shared libs
#  make solaris-x86          for PCs with Solaris
#  make solaris-x86-gcc      for PCs with Solaris using GCC
#  make sunos5-sl            for Suns with SunOS 5.x, make shared libs
#  make sunos5-gcc-sl        for Suns with SunOS 5.x, GCC, make shared libs
#
# To change the compiler modify CC and CXX in the file Make-config under
# the appropriate target from the above list.
#

#
# Install it in the visit directory under the mesa directory.
#
mkdir $VISITDIR/mesa
mkdir $VISITDIR/mesa/5.0
mkdir $VISITDIR/mesa/5.0/$VISITARCH
mkdir $VISITDIR/mesa/5.0/$VISITARCH/{include,lib}
mkdir $VISITDIR/mesa/5.0/$VISITARCH/include/GL
cp include/GL/*.h $VISITDIR/mesa/5.0/$VISITARCH/include/GL
#
# On aix systems you will need to build shared libraries from the
# archives.
#
# cd lib
# ar -x libMesaGL.a
# g++ -Wl,-G -shared -o libMesaGL.so -Wl,-bmaxdata:0x70000000 -Wl,-brtl *.o
# rm *.o
# ar -x libOSMesa.a
# g++ -Wl,-G -shared -o libOSMesa.so -Wl,-bmaxdata:0x70000000 -Wl,-brtl *.o
# rm *.o
# cd ..
#

#
# If you built a 64 bit version of the library on irix, then the library
# will be located in the lib64 directory.
#
cp lib/*.so       $VISITDIR/mesa/5.0/$VISITARCH/lib 
cd ..

VTK
====

VTK is an object oriented library for visualizing 3D data.  VisIt uses it
for all its visualization functionality. Follow the directions listed below
to build VTK.  If you have any problems building or installing VTK, read the
VTK/README.html file included in the VTK distribution for more information.

#
# Build CMake which is used by VTK to configure its distribution
#
gunzip cmake-2.2.3.tar.gz
tar xf cmake-2.2.3.tar
cd cmake-2.2.3

#
# We have experienced problems building CMake on aix with g++/gcc.
# so for aix use the native compilers to build CMake: 
# env CXX=xlC CC=xlc CXXFLAGS="" CFLAGS="" ./bootstrap
# otherwise:
env CXXFLAGS=""  CFLAGS="" ./bootstrap

# We have experienced problems with CMake's build of its curses version,
# (ccmake) either with the curses header or library.  (Mainly with AIX).
# To prevent CMake from attempting to build ccmake, open CMakeCache.txt
# and set CURSES_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=   to ""
make

#
# Build VTK
#
cd ..
gunzip vtk-5.0.0a.tar.gz
tar xf vtk-5.0.0a.tar
cd VTK
#
# On irix systems we have experienced problems with CMake not using the
# -LANG:std for all the tests, so you will need to add it manually.
#
# env CXXFLAGS="-LANG:std" ../cmake-2.2.3/bin/cmake .
#
../cmake-2.2.3/bin/cmake .
#
# Edit CMakeCache.txt.  Turn BUILD_SHARED_LIBS, VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA, and
# VTK_USE_ANSI_STDLIB on (Note that some platforms will have a definition
# for VTK_USE_ANSI_STDLIB and some will not). Turn BUILD_TESTING off.
#
# If you want to change the compilers you should modify CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
# and CMAKE_C_COMPILER.  If you want to change the compiler flags you should
# modify CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS.  You might want to specify "-O2"
# as a compiler flag to build an optimized version.  If you want to specify
# the location of the OpenGL library you should modify OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY and
# OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY (/usr/shlib/libGL.so and /usr/shlib/libGLU.so on tru64
# systems.)
#
# On irix systems you will need to specify "-LANG:std" for the compiler and
# linker flags.  If you are building a 64 bit version you will also need
# to add "-64" to the compiler and linker flags.  These include CMAKE_C_FLAGS,
# CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS, CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS, CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS, and
# CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS,
#
# On aix systems you will need to specify "-mminimal-toc" for CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS.
# You may also experience problems with X11 headers. The default X11 headers
# files that cmake finds are not C++ compliant. Change "/usr/lpp/X11/include"
# to "/usr/include" for CMAKE_X_CFLAGS, X11_X11_INCLUDE_PATH,
# X11_Xlib_INCLUDE_PATH and X11_Xutil_INCLUDE_PATH.
# If this should lead to errors related to standard C++ headers (e.g. stdio), 
# remove the CMAKE_X_CFLAGS string and re-run cmake.
#
../cmake-2.2.3/bin/cmake .
#
# Edit CMakeCache.txt, setting MANGLED_MESA_INCLUDE_DIR, MANGLED_MESA_LIBRARY,
# MANGLED_OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR, MANGLED_OSMESA_LIBRARY, to point to the
# appropriate files and directories in the mesa directory.
# For example:
#
# MANGLED_MESA_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=$VISITDIR/mesa/5.0/$VISITARCH/include
# MANGLED_MESA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=$VISITDIR/mesa/5.0/$VISITARCH/lib/libMesaGL.so
# MANGLED_OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=$VISITDIR/mesa/5.0/$VISITARCH/include
# MANGLED_OSMESA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=$VISITDIR/mesa/5.0/$VISITARCH/lib/libOSMesa.so
#
# Note that you need to be very careful in setting the above variables so
# that you provide the appropriate filename or path.
#
../cmake-2.2.3/bin/cmake .

#
# On tru64 systems using g++ 3.0.4, several files in the Imaging directory
# will not compile because of an internal compiler error.  You will need to
# comment out the code in the method ThreadedExecute (with "#if 0" as the
# first line in the method and "#endif" as the last line in the method.)
# The files are:
#    Imaging/vtkImageContinuousDilate3D.cxx
#    Imaging/vtkImageContinuousErode3D.cxx
#    Imaging/vtkImageConvolve.cxx
#    Imaging/vtkImageRange3D.cxx
#    Imaging/vtkImageVariance3D.cxx
#

#
# On tru64 systems using g++ 3.3.3, you may get messages indicating that
# "-timplicit_local -no_implicit_include" are not supported compiler
# options when building cmake.  Ignore them, the options appear to be
# necessary for things to build properly.
#

#
# On linux systems using icc 9.0, ./Graphics/vtkQuadricClustering.cxx will
# not compile because of an internal compiler error.  You will need to
# replace lines 231 - 233:
#     this->NumberOfDivisions[0] = (int)x > 0 ? (int)x : 1;
#     this->NumberOfDivisions[1] = (int)y > 0 ? (int)y : 1;
#     this->NumberOfDivisions[2] = (int)z > 0 ? (int)z : 1;
# with the lines:
#     int ix = (int) ceil((bounds[1]-this->Bounds[0])/this->DivisionSpacing[0]);
#     int iy = (int) ceil((bounds[3]-this->Bounds[2])/this->DivisionSpacing[1]);
#     int iz = (int) ceil((bounds[5]-this->Bounds[4])/this->DivisionSpacing[2]);
#     this->NumberOfDivisions[0] = ix > 0 ? ix : 1;
#     this->NumberOfDivisions[1] = iy > 0 ? iy : 1;
#     this->NumberOfDivisions[2] = iz > 0 ? iz : 1;
#

# 
# On Altix systems using g++ 3.3.3, the VTK library exhibits a compiler bug.
# (The code works fine when print statements are added, but fails without them).
# The code is in /Common/vtkByteSwap.cxx, which VisIt uses indirectly with 
# reader and writer routines that are used to serialize data sets on the engine
# and send them to the viewer (all binary messages in VTK are big-endian, even
# when both sender and receiver are little-endian).  To get around this 
# compiler bug, modify the vtkByteSwap.cxx file on for the method:
#   template <class T>
#   inline void vtkByteSwapRangeWrite(const T* first, vtkIdType num,
#                                     ostream* os, long)
#  (located at ~line 130)
#
#  From:
#  for(const T* p=first; p != last; ++p)
#    {
#    T temp = *p;
#    vtkByteSwapper<sizeof(T)>::Swap(&temp);
#    os->write((char*)&temp, sizeof(temp));
#    }
#
#
#  To:
#   for(const T* p=first; p != last; ++p)
#    {
#    T temp = *p;
#    vtkByteSwapper<sizeof(T)>::Swap(&temp);
#    T temp2 = *p;
#    vtkByteSwapper<sizeof(T)>::Swap(&temp2);
#    if (temp != temp2)
#        cerr << "A COMPILER BUG HAS BEEN EXPOSED ... CONTACT VISIT TEAM" << endl;
#    os->write((char*)&temp, sizeof(temp));
#    }
#
#  Again, this change has only been found to be necessary for Altix systems 
#  gcc 3.3.3.

# Several of the header files in MangleMesaInclude have absolute paths

# in directories where you built VTK.  This may cause problems if you
# later remove the directories where you built VTK, or if someone else
# were to use your installation and the permissions in your directories
# were incorrect.

Qt
===

The Qt toolkit from Trolltech is a free (for non-commercial use), cross-
platform Graphical User Inteface toolkit that runs on X11, MS Windows, and
Mac-X. VisIt uses Qt as the basis of its GUI and Viewer.  Follow the
directions listed below to build Qt.  You can use Qt version 2.3.0, 3.0.2
or 3.3.2 on all the systems except tru64 where you must can't use 2.3.0.
We recommend using 3.3.2.  If you have any problems building or installing
Qt, read the INSTALL file in the Qt distribution for more information.

#
# Build Qt 3.3.2
#

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# NOTE: if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set in your environment, this command will
# fail.  In this case, just issue:
# setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib

setenv LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH     # SGI

#
# On linux systems using the gcc 2.96 compiler, the compiler has a bug that
# causes most of the text fields that contain numeric values to have 1
# added to the 6th digit.  For example, 1 is displayed as 1.00001. To
# correct this problem you will need to replace the code in the function
# doubleToString in the file src/tools/qlocale.cpp with
#
#     char str[80];
#     sprintf(str, "%g", d);
#     QString num_str(str);
#
#     return num_str;
#
# You will also need to add "#include <stdio.h>" at the beginning of the
# file to get the prototype for sprintf.
#
# On tru64 systems qt generates some unaligned access errors. To
# correct the problem change the following two code blocks in
# src/tools/qlocale.cpp.

Silo
=====

Silo is a self-describing, machine-independent scientific file format.
Silo is one of the file formats supported by VisIt.  Follow the directions
listed below to build Silo.  If you have any problems building or installing
Silo, read the BUILD_NOTES file in the Silo distribution for more information.

#
# Build Silo
#
sh silo060605.sh
cd silo060605

#
#
# On itanium (ia64) systems, the -fPIC flag is needed.  You can replace
# CFLAGS=-O2 with CFLAGS="-fPIC -O2" in the configure command below.
#
# On opteron systems, the -fPIC and -m64 flags are needed. You can replace
# CFLAGS="-O2" with CFLAGS="-m64 -fPIC -O2". You will also need to disable
# SDX by adding --disable-sdx to the end of the configure command.
#
# On irix systems, if you want to build a 64 bit version you can replace
# CFLAGS=-O2 with CFLAGS="-64 -O2" in the configure command below.
#
# If you want to build silo with hdf5 support then use the commented configure
# line.  If you want to build silo with hdf5 support you must first build hdf5,
# which is described later in this document.

Python
=======

Python is a powerful, free scripting language that is used to drive VisIt's
viewer when running VisIt without a GUI. Python is cross platform and runs on
many UNIXes as well as MS Windows and other platforms. VisIt can be configured
to run without Python if scripting features are not desired.  Follow the
directions listed below to build Python.  If you have any problems building
or installing Python, read the README file in the Python distribution for more
information.

Note that instructions for building 2 different versions of Python are given
here because versions of VisIt built using xlc (7.0.0.2 or later) can have 
threading problems that lead to crashes of the CLI when Python 2.1.2 is used.
For that reason, if you are building on AIX using a newer version of xlc,
download the Python 2.4.2 source code from http://www.python.org and use 
it to build VisIt. VisIt will eventually be upgraded to use Python 2.4.2 or
later on all platforms.


Building Python 2.1.2
======================

On itanium (ia64) systems, the -fPIC flag is needed.  On opteron systems,
the "-m64 -fPIC" flags are needed.  To add flags to python's build, do the
following:  (1) Follow the commands below until the configure step.  Execute
configure as given.  (2) Look at the Makefile and find the value of the
variable OPT.  (3) Re-execute configure with OPT specified through the env
command, with the additional flags added to OPT.  For example:

env OPT="-fPIC -O2" ./configure --prefix=$VISITDIR/python/$VISITARCH

where the "-O2" was the value of OPT in the makefile.  (4) Continue with
the commands below as given.

On irix systems, if you want to build a 64 bit version will need to override
the default compiler and linker options.  This is done in a similar fashion
as described above but -64 is added to OPT and LDFLAGS.  For example:

env OPT="-64 -O2" LDFLAGS="-64" ./configure --prefix=$VISITDIR/python/$VISITARCH

#
# Build and install it in the visit directory under the python directory.
#
gunzip Python-2.1.2.tar.gz
tar xf Python-2.1.2.tar
cd Python-2.1.2
./configure --prefix=$VISITDIR/python/$VISITARCH
make
make install

#
# You will also need to create a shared version of the python library.
#
mkdir tmpdir
cd tmpdir
ar -x ../libpython2.1.a
# Use the appropriate command based on the operating system on which
# you are creating the shared library.
g++ -Wl,-G -shared -o ../libpython2.1.so *.o                         # aix
g++ -shared -o ../libpython2.1.so *.o                                # irix

g++ -shared -o ../libpython2.1.so *.o                                # linux
g++ -m64 -shared -o ../libpython2.1.so *.o                           # opteron

Building Python 2.4.2 (AIX instructions)
=========================================

tar zxvf Python-2.4.2.tar.gz
cd Python-2.4.2

#
# Make changes to setup.py
# Comment out lines 469-475, 727-735, 960, 1066
# Save the changes and exit your editor
#

#
# Configure and build Python
#
./configure --with-gcc="xlc_r -q64 -O2" --with-cxx="xlC_r -q64 -O2" --disable-ipv6 AR="ar -X64" --prefix=$VISITDIR/python/$VISITARCH 
make
make install

#
# Create a shared library version of the python library.
#
xlc -qmkshrobj -o libpython2.4.so libpython2.4.a -lm

#
# Install the shared library version of the python library.
#
cp libpython2.4.so $VISITDIR/python/$VISITARCH/lib/python2.4/config/libpython2.4.so
cd ..


Mili (Optional)
================

Mili uses GNU's autoconf system to provide platform independence when
building Mili in a UNIX environment.  It requires both a C and Fortran
compiler.  Its compiler flags are built directly into the configure script
based on platform.  In order to change the flags you must edit the configure
script.

#
# Build Mili.
#
gunzip mili-1.10.tar.gz
tar xf mili-1.10.tar
cd mili

#
# To get mili to build its library without a fortran compiler you will
# need to remove the fortran object files from the libmili dependencies.
# Remove "${MILI_f_SRC:.f=.o} ${MILI_F_SRC:.F=.o}" from src/Makefile.in.
#
# If you want to use a C compiler other than cc do the following:
#
#   In the file configure.in, change the line:
#   dnl AC_PROG_CC
#   to:
#   AC_PROG_CC
#
#   Run autoconf:
#   autoconf
#
#   Add the line:
#   CC = @CC@
#
#   to the files src/Makefile.in and test/Makefile.in before the line:
#   CFLAGS = @CFLAGS@
#
#   When you run configure you will need to set CC to the desired compiler.
#
# On irix systems, if you want to build a 64 bit version will need to override
# the default compiler options.  You will need to replace all occurances of
# "-n32" with "-64" in the configure script.
#
# On itanium (ia64) systems you will need to add -fPIC to the compiler options
# in the configure script.  Add -fPIC to CFLAGS and FFLAGS below the line
# containing "-unknown-linux" in the configure script.
#
# On opteron systems you will need to add "-m64 -fPIC" to the CFLAGS and
# FFLAGS.
#
# If you do not have a fortran compiler on your system then the fortran
# test examples will fail to build.  This is ok.
#
./configure
make

#
# Install it in the visit directory under the mili directory.
#
mkdir $VISITDIR/mili
mkdir $VISITDIR/mili/1.10
mkdir $VISITDIR/mili/1.10/$VISITARCH
cp src/mili.h      $VISITDIR/mili/1.10/$VISITARCH
cp src/mili_enum.h $VISITDIR/mili/1.10/$VISITARCH
cp src/libmili.a   $VISITDIR/mili/1.10/$VISITARCH
cd ..

HDF4 (Optional)
================

HDF4 is a data storage library that lets you write large volumes of data to
disk files and it is the predecessor of HDF5.

#
# Build HDF4.
#
gunzip HDF4.2r1.tar.gz
tar xf HDF4.2r1.tar
cd HDF4.2r1

#
# On itanium (ia64) systems, you will need to add "-fPIC" to the CFLAGS.  On
# opteron systems, you will need to add "-fPIC -m64" to the CFLAGS.
#
env CFLAGS="-O2" LIBS="-lm" ./configure --disable-fortran -prefix=$VISITDIR/hdf4/2.4.1/$VISITARCH

#
# Install it in the visit directory under the hdf4 directory.
#
mkdir $VISITDIR/hdf4
mkdir $VISITDIR/hdf4/2.4.1
mkdir $VISITDIR/hdf4/2.4.1/$VISITARCH
make install
cd ..

HDF5 (Optional)
================

HDF5 is an I/O library that is used by many of the VisIt database plugins.

#
# Build HDF5.
#
gunzip hdf5-1.6.5.tar.gz
tar xf hdf5-1.6.5.tar
cd hdf5-1.6.5

HDF5 can be built as a serial or a parallel library.  Always build the
serial version of HDF5 for VisIt.  Both the serial and parallel versions
of VisIt use the serial version of HDF5.

If HDF5 is already installed on your system in a standard location such
as /usr/local then it may conflict with the version you are now building.
The problem is that a compile line may have include (-I) or library (-L)
directives so that either the header files or library are coming from the
system location and the other is coming from the location where you are
installing the version you are now building.  If this occurs you will have
a run time failure of any plugins that depend on HDF5.  The solution is to
make sure that neither the header files nor the library are coming from
the system location.

HDF5 will by default want to use the vendor supplied compiler so you will
probably need to specify the compiler.  This can be done by preceding the
configure command with "env CC=compiler_name".

On irix systems if you want to build a 64 bit version you will need to
precede the configure command with "env CC="cc -O2 -64" CFLAGS="-O2 -64".
The CC part is to get around a bug in their make system.

On aix systems you will need to specify the appropriate flags to build
either a 32 bit or 64 bit version.  To build a 32 bit version, preceed the
configure command with "env CC="xlc -q32" AR="ar -X 32"".  To build a 64
bit version, preceed the configure command with "env CC="xlc -q64" AR="ar
 -X 64"".

On itanium (ia64) systems you will need to add -fPIC to the compile flags.
This can be done by preceding the configure command with "env CFLAGS=-fPIC".

On opteron systems you will need to add "-m64 -fPIC" to the compile
flags.  This can be done by preceding the configure command with
"env CFLAGS="-m64 -fPIC"".

./configure --disable-shared -prefix=$VISITDIR/hdf5/1.6.5/$VISITARCH
make

#
# Install it in the visit directory under the hdf5 directory.
#
mkdir $VISITDIR/hdf5
mkdir $VISITDIR/hdf5/1.6.5
mkdir $VISITDIR/hdf5/1.6.5/$VISITARCH
make install
cd ..

Boxlib (Optional)
==================

Boxlib is an I/O library for reading and writing structured AMR mesh data.

#
# Build Boxlib.
#
gunzip boxlib.tar.gz
tar xf boxlib.tar
cd CCSEApps/BoxLib

Boxlib does not work on Solaris or Irix systems.  We had to modify boxlib
to use it with VisIt so you will need to contact us for the source code if
you wish to build it.

Boxlib does not build with icc since it includes fortran code which will
lead to unsatisfied externals at runtime.  Most of the fortran consists of
interface routines which could be removed by commenting out all the lines
after the comment "Fortran interface routines." near the bottom of the file
Make.package.  Unfortunately, the C routines call two fortran routines,
which could probably be fairly easily rewritten in C.  Unfortunately that
hasn't been done yet.  The routines are FORT_FASTCOPY and FORT_FASTSETVAL.

You will need to modify GNUmakefile so that it doesn't use MPI.  To do this
change "USE_MPI   = TRUE" to "USE_MPI   = FALSE".

On itanium (ia64) systems you will need to add -fPIC to the compile flags.
This can be done by adding the line "CXXFLAGS += -fPIC" and "FFLAGS += -fPIC"
near the top of the file GNUmakefile.

On opteron systems you will need to add "-m64 -fPIC" to the compile flags.
This can be done by adding the line "CXXFLAGS += -m64 -fPIC" and
"FFLAGS += -m64 -fPIC" near the top of the file GNUmakefile.  You also will
probably want to add optimization flags (i.e. -O2).

#
# Boxlib builds either a 2d or 3d version and VisIt needs both, so you will
# need to build the 3d version, install it and then build the 2d version and
# install it.
#
# You will need to modify GNUmakefile to set the compiler.  Typically, this
# will involve replacing "KCC" with the name of your c++ compiler in the
# line "COMP      = KCC".  If the compiler doesn't match one of the ones
# in the file ../mk/Make.defs, you will need to create an entry for it in
# that file.  The only values of COMP that it understands and are relevant
# for VisIt are g++ and Intel.  If the g++ compiler is referenced by anything
# other than g++, the easiest thing is to change all occurances of g++ with the
# other name in the file ../mk/Make.defs.  For example if the compiler is
# g++-3.2.3, then change all occurances of g++ to g++-3.2.3.
#
# If you are building with icc, you should change "COMP      = KCC" to
# "COMP      = Intel".
#
# If you are using icc 9.0 you should add the following lines
#
#    ifeq ($(findstring Version 9.0, $(__icc_version)), Version 9.0)
#        ICC_VERSION := 9.0
#        ICC_MAJOR_VERSION := 9
#        ICC_MINOR_VERSION := 0
#    endif
#
# to ../mk/Make.defs at the end of the section "ifeq ($(COMP),Intel)".
#
# If you are building with xlC, you should change "COMP      = KCC" to
# "COMP      = xlC" and add the following lines to ../mk/Make.defs.
#
# ifeq ($(COMP),xlC)
#     CXXPRFF    := -p
#     CXXOPTF    += -O2
#     CXXDEBF    += -g
#     CXX        := xlC -qrtti=dynamiccast
# endif
#

#
# Start off by building the 3d version.
#
gmake -f GNUmakefile
#
# If the make fails with complaints about the header file "limits", try
# moving the directory "std" to "std.old" and issuing another make command.
#

#
# Install the 3d version in the visit directory under the boxlib directory.
#
mkdir $VISITDIR/boxlib
mkdir $VISITDIR/boxlib/$VISITARCH

cp libbox3d*.a $VISITDIR/boxlib/$VISITARCH/lib/libbox3D.a
tar cf Boxlib3D.h.tar *.H

#
# Now build the 2d version.
#
gmake clean

#
# You will need to modify the GNUmakefile to set the dimension to 2.  This
# will involve replacing "3" with "2" in the line "DIM       = 3".
#
gmake -f GNUmakefile

#
# Install the 2d version in the visit directory under the boxlib directory.
#

netCDF (Optional)
==================

NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is an interface for array-oriented data
access and a library that provides an implementation of the interface. The
netCDF library also defines a machine-independent format for representing
scientific data. Together, the interface, library, and format support the
creation, access, and sharing of scientific data. NetCDF uses GNU's autoconf
system to provide a platform-independent build process.

#
# Build netCDF (without Fortran support)
#
gunzip netcdf.tar.gz
tar xvf netcdf.tar
cd netcdf-3.6.0-p1/src

mkdir $VISITDIR/netcdf

#
# On itanium (ia64) systems, you should add "-fPIC" to the following CFLAGS
# and CXXFLAGS.  On opteron systems, you should add "-fPIC -m64" to the

cd ../..


CGNS (Optional)
================

The CFD General Notation System (CGNS) consists of a collection of 
conventions, and software implementing those conventions, for the storage
and retrieval of CFD (computational fluid dynamics) data. The principal 
target of CGNS is data normally associated with compressible viscous flow
(i.e., the Navier-Stokes equations), but the standard is also applicable
to subclasses such as Euler and potential flows.

# On SGI, you may want to add -64 to the CFLAGS to build a 64 bit binary.
# Note that if you do that then after you configure, you will have to remove
# "-n32" from the make.SGI file that configure creates.
#
# On itanium (ia64) systems, you should add "-fPIC" to the CFLAGS.
#
# On opteron systems, you should add "-fPIC -m64" to the CFLAGS.
#

env CFLAGS="-O2" ./configure --prefix=$VISITDIR/cgns/2.4/$VISITARCH
make

#
# Install it in the visit directory under the cgns directory
#
make install
cd ..


GDAL (Optional)
================

GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats that presents
a single abstract data model to the calling application for all supported
formats. 

#
# Build GDAL
#
gunzip gdal-1.3.0.tar.gz
tar xvf gdal-1.3.0.tar
cd gdal-1.3.0

mkdir $VISITDIR/gdal
mkdir $VISITDIR/gdal/1.3.0
mkdir $VISITDIR/gdal/1.3.0/$VISITARCH

#
# On itanium (ia64) systems, you should add "-fPIC" to the CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS.
#
# On opteron systems, you should add "-fPIC -m64" to the CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS.
#
# On AIX systems where you build a 64 bit library using xlC, add the following
# to the front of the configure line:
#     env CC=xlc CXX=xlC CFLAGS="-q64 -qcpluscmt -O2" CXXFLAGS="-q64 -O2"
#
# Some systems may have problems building mysql support. If that is the case
# you will need to add "--without-mysql" at the end of the following configure
# command.
#
env CXXFLAGS="-O2" CFLAGS="-O2" ./configure --prefix=$VISITDIR/gdal/1.3.0/$VISITARCH --with-libtiff=internal --with-gif=internal --with-png=internal --with-jpeg=internal --with-libz=internal --with-netcdf=no --without-jasper --enable-static --disable-shared --without-python
make

#
# Install GDAL in the visit directory under the gdal directory
#
make install
cd ..


CFITSIO (Optional)
===================

CFITSIO is a library for reading FITS files. FITS stands for `Flexible Image 
Transport System' and is the standard astronomical data format endorsed by 
both NASA and the IAU. FITS is much more than an image format (such as JPG 
or GIF) and is primarily designed to store scientific data sets consisting 
of multi-dimensional arrays (1-D spectra, 2-D images or 3-D data cubes) and
2-dimensional tables containing rows and columns of data.

#
# Build CFITSIO
#
gunzip cfitsio3006.tar.gz
tar xvf cfitsio3006.tar
cd cfitsio

mkdir $VISITDIR/cfitsio
mkdir $VISITDIR/cfitsio/3006
mkdir $VISITDIR/cfitsio/3006/$VISITARCH

#
# You should specify the compiler because otherwise CFITSIO's configure
# script will first look for a proprietary compiler before reverting to
# gcc. If you want to use gcc or another compiler from the beginning then
# you should provide it on the configure line.
#
# On AIX systems where you build 64 bit libraries using xlc, add the following
# to the front of the configure line:
#    CC=xlc CFLAGS="-q64 -O2"
#
#
env CC=gcc ./configure --prefix=$VISITDIR/cfitsio/3006/$VISITARCH 
make

#
# Install CFITSIO in the visit directory under the cfitsio directory
#
make install
cd ..


VisIt
======

VisIt uses GNU's autoconf system to provide platform independence when
building VisIt in a UNIX environment. Autoconf creates a script called
configure that tests your system for various libraries and programs required
to build VisIt.  Follow the directions listed below to build VisIt.
More information about building VisIt follows after that.

#
# Build and install it in the visit directory.
#
gunzip visit060918.tar.gz
tar xf visit060918.tar
cd visit060918/config-site
echo VISITHOME=$VISITDIR > `hostname`.conf
sed "s/ARCH/$VISITARCH/" Template.conf >> `hostname`.conf
cd ..

#
# For itanium (ia64) systems add the -fPIC flag to the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
# in the env command for configure.  For opteron systems add the "-m64 -fPIC"
# flags to the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS in the env command for configure.
#
env CFLAGS=-O2 CXXFLAGS=-O2 ./configure
make
clearcase_bin/visit-bin-dist

#
# Use the appropriate install command based on the operating system on
# which you built VisIt.
#
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.5.4 aix $VISITDIR
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.5.4 darwin $VISITDIR
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.5.4 irix6 $VISITDIR
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.5.4 linux $VISITDIR
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.5.4 linux-ia64 $VISITDIR
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.5.4 linux-x86_64 $VISITDIR
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.5.4 osf1 $VISITDIR
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.5.4 sunos5 $VISITDIR

When running the configure script you can enable or disable certain dependent
packages.  All the configure options are listed at the beginning of the
configure script or can listed by the configure script by typing
"./configure -help".  The most commonly used options are:

  --enable-parallel       make the parallel version
  --disable-scripting     build without Python scripting capability
  --enable-java           build the Java interface library
  --enable-buildall       build all plugins

  --with-netcdf=INC,LIB   Location of NetCDF header and library

  --with-hdf5=INC,LIB     Location of HDF5 header and library
  --with-vbt=INC,LIB      Location of VBT/DSL headers and libraries
  --with-saf=INC,LIB      Location of SAF headers and libraries

  --with-exodus[=<DIR>]           enable Exodus driver
  --with-exodus-include[=<DIR>]   specify Exodus include path
  --with-exodus-lib[=<DIR>]       specify Exodus lib path

The enable parallel option builds the parallel version of VisIt.  Parallel
versions are supported on SGI, IBM AIX, Tru64, and some linux systems.  The
disable scripting option builds VisIt without the Python scripting.  The
enable buildall option builds all the VisIt plugins.  By default, only the
most common plugins are built.

The second group of options are used when building with support for reading
SAF files.  The third group of options are used when building with support
for reading exodus files.

Some platforms (especially SUSE) have compilation problems with 
"plots/Volume/avtOpenGL3DTextureVolumeRenderer.C".  We are currently working
on using an extension wrangler type approach to deal with this.  In the
interim, you can avoid this problem by adding:

#ifndef VTK_IMPLEMENT_MESA_CXX
extern PFNGLTEXIMAGE3DEXTPROC glTexImage3D;
#endif

to the file after the standard includes.

If you have any problems send e-mail to visit-help@llnl.gov.
