More specifically, the Clip operator can clip away box- or sphere-shaped regions from a database. The database remains in its original dimension after being clipped by the Clip operator and since the Clip operator manipulates the database before it is plotted, the surfaces bounding the removed regions are preserved in the final plot. While being geared primarily towards 3D databases, the Clip operator also clips 2D databases. When applied to 2D databases, the Clip operator can remove rectangular or circular regions from the database. figure shows a Pseudocolor and Mesh plots with a Clip operator.
