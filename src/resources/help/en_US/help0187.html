<h2>Setting isosurface levels</h2>
<p>
By default, VisIt constructs 10 levels into which the data fall. These levels are linearly interpolated values between the data minimum and data maximum. However, you can set your own number of levels, specify the levels you want to see or indicate the percentages for the levels.

<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure37"></a><img src="../images/Operators/isosurfacewindow.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 37</i></td></tr></table></center><br>To choose how levels are specified, make a selection from the <b>Select by</b> menu. The available options are: <b>N levels, Levels</b>, and <b>Percent</b>. <b>N levels</b>, the default method, allows you to specify the number of levels that will be generated, with 10 being the default. <b>Levels</b> requires you to specify real numbers for the levels you want to see. <b>Percent</b> takes a list of percentages like 50.5 60 40. Using the numbers just mentioned, the first isosurface would be placed at the value which is 50.5% of the way between the minimum and maximum data values. The next isosurface would be placed at the value that is 60% of the way between the minimum and maximum data values, and so forth. You specify all values for setting the number of isosurfaces by typing into the text field to the right of the <b>Select by</b> menu.
