<h2>Enabling and Disabling Plugins</h2>
<p>
All of VisIt's plots, operators, and database readers are implemented as plugins that are loaded when VisIt first starts up. Some plugins are not likely to be used by most people so they should not be loaded. The <b>Plugin Manager Window</b> provides a mechanism that allows you to turn plugins on and off. The window has three tabs: <b>Plots</b>, <b>Operators</b>, and <b>Databases</b>. Each tab displays a list of plugins that can be loaded by VisIt. If a plugin is enabled, it has a check by its name. 
</p>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure8"></a><img src="../images/Preferences/pluginwindow.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 8</i></td></tr></table></center><br>You can turn plugins on and off by checking or unchecking the check box next to a plugin's name. If you save your preferences after having turned some plugins off, VisIt will not load those plugins when you next run VisIt. If you instead turned some plugins on, those plugins will be loaded when you next run VisIt.
</p>
<p>
If you have used the <b>Plugin Manager Window</b> to disable certain plot and operator plugins, they will not appear in the <b>Plot</b> and <b>Operator</b> menus. You can enable the plot and operator plugins again the controls in the <b>Plugin Manager Window</b>.
