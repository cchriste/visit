<h2>Pick Window</h2>
<p>
Each time a new pick point is added to the visualization window by clicking on a plot, VisIt extracts information about the pick point from the plot's database and displays it in the <b>Pick Window</b> (figure) and the <b>Output Window</b>. If the <b>Pick Window</b> does not automatically open after picking, you can open the <b>Pick Window</b> by selecting the <b>Pick</b> option from the <b>Main Window's Controls</b> menu. 
</p>
<p>
The <b>Pick Window</b> mainly consists of a group of tabs, each of which displays the values from a pick point. The tab label A, B, C, etc. corresponds to the pick point label in the visualization window. Since there is a fixed number of tabs in the <b>Pick Window</b>, tabs are recycled as the number of pick points increases. When a pick point is added, the next available tab, which is usually the tab to the right of the last unused tab, is populated with the pick information. If the rightmost tab already contains pick information, the leftmost tab is recycled and the process repeats. To see a complete list of picked points, open the <b>Output Window</b>.
</p>
<p>
The information displayed in each tab consists of the database name and timestep, the coordinates of the pick point, the zone/cell that contains the pick point, the nodes that make up the cell containing the pick point, and the picked variables. The rest of the <b>Pick Window</b> is devoted to setting options that format the pick output.
