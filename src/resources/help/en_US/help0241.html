<h2>Saving stereo images</h2>
<p>
When the <b>Stereo</b> check box is turned on and you save an image, VisIt will save a separate image for the left eye and for the right eye. The cameras used to generate each image are offset such that when the images are played together at high rates, they appear to have more depth. To enable saving of stereo images, click the <b>Stereo</b> check box in the <b>Save Window</b> before you try to save an image.
</p>
<p>
When <b>Family</b> mode is not in effect, VisIt will prepend <i>left_</i> and <i>right_</i> designators to the saved filenames. However, when <b>Family</b> mode is in effect, VisIt saves the two images in sequence without any left/right designation. The left image is saved first followed by the right image. If next available number in the <b>Family</b> is odd, the left will be odd and right will be even. On the other hand, if next available number in the <b>Family</b> is even, the left will be even and right will be odd. However, the notification messages VisIt produces about the saved images may only mention the first (left) saved image filename.
