<h2>Saving stereo images</h2>
<p>
When the <b>Stereo</b> check box is turned on and you save an image, VisIt will save a separate image for the left eye and for the right eye. The cameras used to generate each image are offset such that when the images are played together at high rates, they appear to have more depth. To enable saving of stereo images, click the <b>Stereo</b> check box in the <b>Save Window</b> before you try to save an image.
