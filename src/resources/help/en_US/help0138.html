<h2>Setting the number of vectors</h2>
<p>
When visualizing a large database, a Vector plot will often have too many vectors. The Vector plot becomes incomprehensible with too many vectors. VisIt provides controls to thin the number of vectors to a number that looks appealing in a visualization. You can accomplish this reduction by setting a fixed number of vectors or by setting a stride. To set a fixed number of vectors, select the <b>N vectors</b> radio button and enter a new number of vectors into the <b>N vectors</b> text field. To reduce the number of vectors by setting the stride, select the <b>Stride</b> radio button and enter a new stride value into the <b>Stride</b> text field.
