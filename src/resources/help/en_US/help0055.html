<h2>Setting point properties</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure11"></a><img src="../images/Plots/pointtypes.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 11</i></td></tr></table></center><br>Albeit rare, the Boundary and FilledBoundary plots can be used to plot points that belong to different materials. Both plots provide controls that allow you to set the representation and size of the points. You can change the points' representation using the different <b>Point Type</b> radio buttons. The available options are: <b>Box</b>, <b>Axis</b>, <b>Icosahedron</b>, <b>Point</b>, and <b>Sphere </b>(see figure). The default point type is <b>Point</b> because that is the fastest to draw, followed by <b>Sphere</b>. The other point types create additional geometry and can take longer to appear on the screen and subsequently draw. To change the size of the points when the point type is set to <b>Box</b>, <b>Axis</b>, or <b>Icosahedron</b>, you can enter a new floating point value into the <b>Point size</b> text field. When the point type is set to <b>Point</b> or <b>Sphere</b>, the <b>Point size</b> text field becomes the <b>Point size (pixels)</b> text field and you should enter your point size in terms of pixels. Finally, you can opt to scale the points' glyphs using a scalar expression by turning on the <b>Scale point size by variable</b> check box and by selecting a scalar variable from the <b>Variable</b> button to the right of that check box. Note that point scaling does not occur when the point type is set to <b>Point</b> or <b>Sphere</b>.
