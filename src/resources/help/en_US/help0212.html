<h2>Positioning the slice plane</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure54"></a><img src="../images/Operators/slicewindow.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 54</i></td></tr></table></center><br>You can position the slice plane by setting the origin, normal, and up-axis vectors in the <b>Slice operator </b><b>attributes window,</b> shown in figure. The slice plane is specified using the origin-normal form of a plane where all that is needed to specify the plane are two vectors; the origin and the normal. The origin of the plane is a point in the slice plane. The normal vector is a vector that is perpendicular to the slice plane. 
</p>
<p>
VisIt allows the slice plane normal to be aligned to a specific axis or it can be set to any arbitrary vector. If you want the slice plane to be along any of the three axes, click the <b>X-Axis</b>, <b>Y-Axis</b>, or <b>Z-Axis</b> radio button. If you want to make a slice plane that does not align with the principle axes, click the <b>Arbitrary</b> radio button and then type a direction vector into the text field to the right of the <b>Arbitrary</b> radio button. The vector need not be normalized since VisIt will normalize the vector before using it.

The middle of the <b>Slice operator attributes window</b>, or <b>Origin area</b> (see figure), provides the necessary controls required to set the slice plane origin. The <b>Origin area</b> provides five radio buttons: <b>Point</b>, <b>Intercept</b>, <b>Percent</b>, <b>Zone</b>, and <b>Node</b>. Clicking on one of these radio buttons causes the <b>Origin area</b> to display the appropriate controls for setting the slice plane origin.
</p>
<p>
To set the slice plane origin to a specific point, click the <b>Point</b> radio button in the <b>Origin area</b> and then type a new 3D point into the <b>Point</b> text field. To set the slice plane origin to a specific value along the principle slice axis (usually an orthogonal slice), click the <b>Intercept</b> radio button and then type a new value into the <b>Intercept</b> text field.
</p>
<p>
If you don't know a good value to use for the intercept, consider using the percent slice mode. Percent slice mode, which is most often used for an orthogonal slice, allows you to slice along a particular axis using some percentage of the distance along that axis. For example, this allows you to see what the slice plane looks like if its origin is 50% of the distance along the X-Axis. To set the origin using a percentage of the distance along an axis, click the <b>Percent</b> radio button and then type a new percentage value into the <b>Percent</b> text field or use the <b>Percent</b> slider.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it is useful to slice through a particular zone or node. The Slice operator allows you to pick an origin for the slice plane so a specific zone or node lies in the slice plane. To make sure that a particular zone is sliced by the Slice operator, click on the <b>Zone</b> radio button and then enter the zone to be sliced into the <b>Zone</b> text field. Be sure to also enter the domain that contains the zone into the <b>Domain</b> text field if you are slicing a multi-domain database. If you want to make sure that the slice plane's origin is at a specific node in a mesh, click the <b>Node</b> radio button and enter a new node number into the <b>Node</b> text field. Note that you must also specify a domain if you are slicing a multi-domain database.
</p>
<p>
Use the up-axis vector when you want the slice plane to be projected to 2D. The up-axis vector is a vector that lies in the slice plane and defines a 2D coordinate system within the plane where the up-axis vector corresponds to the Y-axis. To change the up-axis vector, type a new 3D vector into the <b>Direction</b> text field in the <b>Up Axis</b> area of the window.
