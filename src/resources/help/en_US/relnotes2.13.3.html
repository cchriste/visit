<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.13.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Restoring sessions with different sources from GUI now works, even if the session's gui file is missing.</li>
  <li>Adjust logic in Tecplot plugin to only do all-to-all curve definition if the first variable listed does not appear to be a coordinate variable.</li>
  <li>Applied patch for MFEM plugin that reads "lod" tag to set proper LOD.</li>
  <li>Fixed viewer crash that could occur when deleting windows containing lineout curves.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug in CracksClipper gui restricting Strain var to Symmetric Tensors. It will now also accept Tensor vars.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with defining symmetric tensors, where it was impossible to set the expression <i>Type</i> to <i>Symmetric Tensor Mesh Variable</i> and define an expression that could successfully be used elsewhere in VisIt. Symmetric tensors can now be defined using either all 4 components or all 9 components of the tensor, repeating variables as so that the expression is actually a symmetric tensor. For example, a 2D Symmetric Tensor would be defined as "{{a,b},{b,c}}" and a 3D Symmetric Tensor would be defined as "{{a,b,c},{b,d,e},{c,e,f}}".</li>
  <li>The Line3D annotation object's default arrow is now cone shaped instead of flat, and its initial size is in relation to the current extents of the data being drawn.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Enhancements"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.13.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>When re-interpreting 1D meshes as curves, add support for those meshes being multi-block meshes thereby enabling support for multi-block curves.</li>
  <li>Added support for CQUAD8 to NASTRAN Database reader.</li>
  <li>Host profiles were added for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories' Pascal system.</li>
</ul>
