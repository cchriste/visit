<h2>Setting the remote user name</h2>
<p>
The remote user name is the name of the account that you want to use when you access the remote computer. The remote user name does not have to match your local user name and it is often the case that your desktop user name will not match your remote user name. To change the remote user name, type a new user name into the <b>Username</b> text field in the <b>Selected profile</b> settings.
