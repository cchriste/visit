<h2>Playing animations</h2>
<p>
The <b>File panel</b> contains a set of <b>VCR buttons</b> that allow you to put VisIt into an animation mode that plays your visualization using all of the time steps in the database. The <b>VCR buttons</b> are only active when you have a time varying database. The leftmost VCR button moves the animation back one frame. The VCR button second from the left plays the animation in reverse. The middle VCR button stops the animation. The VCR button second from the right plays the animation. The VCR button farthest to the right advances the animation by one frame. As the animation progresses, the <b>Animation Slider</b> and the <b>Animation Text Field</b> are updated to reflect the active time step.
