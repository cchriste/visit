<h2>Animation playback speed</h2>
<p>
The animation playback speed is used when playing flipbook or keyframe animations. The playback speed determines how fast VisIt cycles through the database states that make up the animation. Rather than using states per second as a measurement for the playback speed, VisIt uses a simple scale of slower to faster. To set the animation playback speed, use the <b>Animation speed</b> slider. Moving the slider to the left and slower setting slows down animations so they change time states once every few seconds. Moving the slider to the right and faster setting will make VisIt play the animation as fast as the host graphics hardware allows.
