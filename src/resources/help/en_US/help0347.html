<h2>Executing a query</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure11"></a><img src="../images/Quantitative/queryovertimewindow.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 11</i></td></tr></table></center><br>VisIt has many queries from which to choose. You can choose the type of query to execute by clicking on the name of the query in the <b>Queries list</b>. The <b>Queries list</b> usually displays the names of all of the queries that VisIt knows how to execute. If you instead want to view a subset of the queries, grouped by function, you can make a selection from the <b>Display as</b> combo box. Once you have clicked on a query in the <b>Query list</b>, the <b>Query parameters</b> area updates to show the controls that you need to edit the parameters for the query. In the case of a point query like Pick, the only parameters you need to specify are the 3D point where VisIt will extract values and the names of the variables that you want to examine. Once you specify the query parameters, click the <b>Query</b> button to tell VisIt to process the query. Once VisIt has fulfilled your request, the query results are displayed in the <b>Query results</b> at the bottom of the <b>Query Window</b>.
