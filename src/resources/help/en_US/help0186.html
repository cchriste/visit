The Isosurface operator takes as input a database and a list of values and creates a set of isosurfaces through the database. An isosurface is a surface where every point on the surface has the same data value. You can use an isosurface to see a surface through cells that contain a certain value. The Isosurface operator performs essentially the same visualization operation as the Contour plot, but it allows the resulting data to be used in VisIt's other plots. For example, an Isosurface operator can be applied to a Pseudocolor plot where the Isosurface variable is different from the Pseudocolor variable. In that case, not only are the isosurfaces shown, but they are colored by another variable. An example of the Isosurface operator is shown in figure.
