<h2>Selecting a plot</h2>
<p>
Since VisIt will only let you modify active plots, you must be able to select plots. To select a plot, click on its entry in the <b>Plot list</b>. Multiple plots can be selected by holding down the <i>Ctrl</i> key and clicking plot entries one at a time. Alternatively, groups of plot entries can be selected by clicking on a plot entry and then clicking another plot entry while holding down the <i>Shift</i> key.
