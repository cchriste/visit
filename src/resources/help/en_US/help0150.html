<h2>Adding an operator</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure2"></a><img src="../images/Operators/operatormenu.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 2</i></td></tr></table></center><br>You add operators by making a selection from the <b>Operators</b> menu, shown in figure, which you activate by clicking on the <b>Operators</b> option in the <b>Plots and Operators</b> menu. If you do not see an operator listed in this chapter in the <b>Operators</b> menu then the operator might not be loaded by default. If you want to enable additional operators, use the <b>Plugin Manager Window</b>. When you select an operator, it applies operator to the selected plots in the Plot list unless the <b>Apply operators to all plots</b> check box is checked, in which case, the selected operator is applied to all plots in the <b>Plot list</b>. By default, operators are applied to all plots in the <b>Plot list</b>.
</p>
<p>
When you add an operator to a plot, the name of the operator appears in the plot list entry to the left of the variable or any previously applied operator. If you apply an operator to an already generated plot, the plot is regenerated immediately with the applied operator. If a plot has not yet been generated (its entry is green), then the operator does not take effect until the plot is generated. This provides time for setting the operator attributes.

<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure3"></a><img src="../images/Operators/applyoperator.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 3</i></td></tr></table></center><br>It is also possible to apply an operator by clicking an operator attributes window's <b>Apply</b> button. If you click the <b>Apply</b> button when there is no operator of the specified type has been applied to the selected plot, you can apply the operator and any changes you made by clicking the <b>Yes</b> button in a dialog window (see figure) that asks whether or not the operator should be applied to the plot.
