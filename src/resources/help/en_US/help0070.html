<h2>Setting the number of bins</h2>
<p>
The Histogram plot divides a variable's data range into a number of bins and then counts the weighted values that fall within each bin. The bins and the counted data are then used to create a graph that represents the distribution of data within the variable's data range. As the Histogram plot uses more bins, the graph of data distribution becomes more accurate. However, the graph can also become rougher because as the number of bins increases, the likelihood that no data values fall within a particular bin also increases. To set the number of bins for the Histogram plot, type a new number of bins into the <b>Number of Bins</b> text field and click the <b>Apply</b> button in the <b>Histogram plot attributes window</b>.
