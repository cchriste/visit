<h2>Setting the parallel time limit</h2>
<p>
The parallel time limit is the amount of time given to the scheduling program to tell it the maximum amount of time, usually in minutes, that your program will be allowed to run. The parallel time limit is one of the factors that determines when your compute engine will be run and smaller time limits often have a greater likelihood of running before jobs with large time limits. To specify a parallel time limit, click the <b>Default Time Limit</b> check box and enter a number of minutes or hours into the <b>Default Time Limit</b> text field. If you want to specify minutes, be sure to append "m" to the number or append an "h" for hours. If you want to specify a timeout of 30 minutes, you would type: <i>30m</i>.
