Plots to which the Slice operator has been applied are turned into 2D planar surfaces that are coplanar with the slice plane. The resulting plot can be left as a 2D slice in 3D space or it can be projected to 2D space where other operations can be done to it. A Pseudocolor plot to which a Slice operator has been applied is shown in figure.
