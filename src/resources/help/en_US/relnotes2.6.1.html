    VisIt Launch Script Fixes
    <ul>
    <li>A correction was made to fix a problem where some command line arguments would be passed to subsequent components in the wrong order when the "-s script_file" option was used. In particular the internal launcher was modified so that all arguments that are passed on to subsequent components are passed before the "-s script_file" command line option.</li>
    <li>The launch script was too aggressive about using the loopback interface when launching parallel compute engines on a local node. This interfered with the compute engine's ability to connect back to the viewer when run on a different node in a cluster from where the viewer was running. This problem was limited to running a parallel job on a login node or in an mxterm.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>The DDCMD file format reader was fixed so it can read sets of files whose aggregate size exceeds 4Gb.</li>
<li>The XRay Image Query has had several bugs corrected that sometimes resulted in artifacts in the output images. The artifacts occured when the cells had faces with small areas (less than approximately 1e-5) or where there were cells with quadrilateral faces that were non-planar.</li>
<li>The compute engine's cell count variables were changed from integer to long precision. This fixes a problem where having over 1 billion cells in a dataset could cause the engine to think it was scalable rendering mode but never send back an image to the viewer.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed whereby necessary support libraries were not installed, causing failure with Python Expressions.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed with exporting BOV files after using the Resample operator.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed with reading BOV files that have BYTE_OFFSETs bigger than 2^32 bytes.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed with picking Nek5000 files with more than one variable.</li>
<li>Several annotation types were not showing the proper time value in movies containing transparency when the parallel version of VisIt's compute engine was used. The <i>time slider</i>, <i>text</i>, and <i>3D text</i> annotations were afflicted.</li>
<li>A bug was corrected with the Xdmf reader where it would incorrectly report that vector variables defined on multi block meshes were invalid.</li>
