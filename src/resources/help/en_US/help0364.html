<p>
One-dimensional curves, created using data from 2D or 3D plots, are popular for analyzing data because they are simple to compare. VisIt's visualization windows can be put into a mode that allows you to draw lines, along which data are extracted, in the visualization window. The extracted data are turned into a Curve plot in another visualization window. If no other visualization window exists, VisIt creates one and adds the Curve plot to it. Curve plots are often more useful than 2D Pseudocolor plots because they allow the data along a line to be seen spatially as a 1D curve instead of relying on differences in color to convey information. Furthermore, the curve data can be exported to curve files that allow the data to be imported into other Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory curve analysis software such as <i>Ultra</i>.
