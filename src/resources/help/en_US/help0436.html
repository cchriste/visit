<h2>Using view commands</h2>
<p>
The <b>View Window</b> contains a <b>Commands</b> text field that allows you to enter one or more semi-colon delimited legacy MeshTV commands to change the view. The following table has a description of the supported view commands:

<tr>
<td>
pan x y</td>
<td>
Pans the 3D view to the left/right or up/down. The x, y arguments, which are floating point fractions of the screen in the range [0,1], determine how much the view is panned in the X and Y dimensions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
pan3 x y</td>
<td>
Same as pan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
panx x</td>
<td>
Pans the 3D view left or right. The x argument is a floating point fraction of the screen in the range [0,1].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
pany y</td>
<td>
Pans the 3D view up or down. The yargument is a floating point fraction of the screen in the range [0,1].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ytrans y</td>
<td>
Same as pany.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
rotx x</td>
<td>
Rotates the 3D view about the X-axis x degrees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
rx x</td>
<td>
Same as rotx.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
roty y</td>
<td>
Rotates the 3D view about the Y-axis y degrees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
rotz z</td>
<td>
Rotates the 3D view about the Z-axis z degrees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
rz z</td>
<td>
Same as rotz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
zoom val</td>
<td>
Scales the 3D zoom factor. If you provide a value of 2.0 for the val argument, the object being viewed will appear twice as large. A value of 0.5 for the val argument will make the object appear only half as large.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
zf</td>
<td>
Same as zoom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
zoom3</td>
<td>
Same as zoom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
vp x0 x1 y0 y1</td>
<td>
Sets the window, which is how much space relative to the plot will be visible inside of the viewport, for the 2D view. All arguments are floating point numbers that are in the same range as the plot extents. The x0 and x1 arguments are the minimum and maximum values for the edges of the window in the X dimension. The y0 and y1 arguments are the minimum and maximum values for the edges of the window in the Y dimension.</td>
