<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.7.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The failure of ray-casted volume plot to correctly parse a compound var (eg <i>"foo/bar/density"</i>) when in log-scale mode was corrected (<a href="https://visitbugs.ornl.gov/issues/1778">ticket #1778</a>).</li>
<li>Command recording for Time picks resulted in an empty 'time_options' argument (<a href="https://visitbugs.ornl.gov/issues/1778">ticket #1780</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed a failure with Pick and Query from the CLI with a single non-default variable specified in 'vars' argument (<a href="https://visitbugs.ornl.gov/issues/1778">ticket #1784</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could crash the engine or deliver bad results when Index Select operator applied to a Contour plot (<a href="https://visitbugs.ornl.gov/issues/1462">ticket #1462</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed host-profile creation on Windows to include full 'host.domain' as host Alias.</li>

</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.7.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>When creating images via the movie wizard or the command line option -movie one can now specify the initial frame value. That is instead of starting the series at 0 each time one specify the initial frame value instead. This option can be specified in the movie wizard on the "Chose Length" page or with the command line argument "-frame value". </li>
<li>In zoom mode for 2D and 3D views the shift left mouse will now pan, a simple left mouse will continue to rectangular rubber band zoom and a ctrl left mouse will unzoom.  The shift left mouse pan action matches the Navigate2D/3D mode for panning. Previously in zoom mode the shift left would create a square zoom and was not used heavily.</li>
<li>Several enhancements were made to the BOUT reader. They include:
  <ul>
    <li>The absolute value of the variable is displayed when displaying a variable on the diverter.</li>
    <li>The grid above the upper X point is not displayed in a two X point grid.</li>
    <li>The entire lower diverter is now displayed. You can use the subset window to eliminate portions of the lower diverter if you want to do so.</li>
    <li>The upper diverter is now displayed in a two X point grid.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>The multi-pass discretization of CSG meshes was enhanced so that it now supports a maximum of 512 boundaries per region instead of 512 boundaries in the entire mesh.</li>
</ul>
