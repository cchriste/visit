<h2>Locking time</h2>
<p>
If you have created plots from related databases in multiple visualization windows, you can lock the visualization windows together in time so as you change time in one visualization window, it updates in all other visualization windows that are locked in time.To lock a visualization window in time, select the <b>Lock-&gt;Time</b> option from the <b>Main Window's Window</b> menu.
</p>
<p>
Locking visualization windows together in time may cause VisIt to prompt you to create a new database correlation that involves all of the databases in the visualization windows that are locked in time. VisIt creates a database correlation because the visualization windows must use a common time slider to really be locked in time. If the visualization windows did not use a common time slider then changing time in one visualization window would not cause other visualization windows to update. Once VisIt creates a suitable database correlation for all windows, the active time slider is set to that database correlation in all visualization windows that are locked in time. If you alter a database correlation at this point, it will cause the time state in each locked visualization window to change. Since the same database correlation is used in all locked visualization windows, changing the time state for the database correlation changes the time state in all of the locked windows. This frees you to examine time-varying database behavior without having to set the time state independently in each visualization window.
