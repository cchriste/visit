<h2>Inverting the clipped region</h2>
<p>
Once the Clip operator has been applied to plots and a region has been clipped away, clicking the <b>Invert</b> check box brings back the clipped region and clips away the region that was previously unclipped. Using the <b>Invert</b> check box is an easy way to get only the clipped region back so it can be used for other operations.

<p>
A common trick when creating animations is to have two identical plots with identical Clip operators applied and then switch one Clip operator to have an inverted clipping region. This will make the plot appear whole. The plot with the inverted clipping region can then be transformed independently of the first plot so it appears to slide out of the first plot. Then it is common to fade out the second plot and zoom in on the first plot's clipped region.
