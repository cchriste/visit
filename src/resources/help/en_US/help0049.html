<h2>Changing colors</h2>
<p>
The main portion of the <b>Boundary plot attributes window </b>and<b> FilledBoundary plot attributes window</b>, also known as the <b>Boundary colors area</b>, is devoted to setting material boundary colors. The <b>Boundary colors area</b> contains a list of material names with an associated material color. Boundary plot and FilledBoundary plot colors can be assigned three different ways, the first of which uses a color table. A color table is a named palette of colors that you can customize to suite your needs. When the Boundary plot or FilledBoundary plot use a color table to color subsets, they selects colors that are evenly spaced through the color table based on the number of subsets. For example, if you have three materials and you are coloring them using the "xray" color table, three colors are picked out of the color table so your material boundaries are colored black, gray, and white. To color a Boundary plot or FilledBoundary plot with a color table, click on the <b>Color table radio button</b> and choose a color table from the <b>Color table menu</b> to right of the <b>Color table radio button</b>. 
</p>
<p>
If you want all subsets to be the same color, click the <b>Single</b> radio button at the top of the <b>Boundary plot attributes window</b> and select a new color from the <b>Popup color menu</b> that is activated by clicking on the <b>Single color button</b> . The opacity slider next to the <b>Single color button</b> sets the opacity for the single color.
</p>
<p>
Clicking the <b>Multiple</b> radio button causes each material boundary to be a different, user-specified color. By default, multiple colors are set using the colors of the discrete color table that is active when the Boundary or FilledBoundary plot is created. To change the color for any of the materials, select one or more materials from the list of materials and click on the <b>Color button</b> to the right of the <b>Multiple</b> radio button and select a new color from the <b>Popup color menu</b>. To change the opacity for a material, move <b>Multiple</b> opacity slider to the left to make the material more transparent or move the slider to the right to make the material more opaque.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Boundary plot attributes window</b> contains a list of material names with an associated color. To change a material's color, select one or more materials from the list, click the color button and select a new color from the popup color menu.
