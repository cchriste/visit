<h2>Showing curve labels</h2>
<p>
In addition to line style and line width, Curve plots have a label that can be displayed to help distinguish a Curve plot from other Curve plots. Curve plot labels are on by default, but if you want to turn the label off, you can uncheck the <b>Labels</b> check box.
