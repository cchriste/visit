<tr>
<td>
<p>Centroid</p></td>
<td>
<p>DB</p></td>
<td>
<p>This query will calculate the centroid of a dataset. The contribution of each cell is calculated assuming its mass all lies at the center of the cell. If the query is performed on a Pseudocolor plot, the plot's variable will be assumed to be density. If the query is performed on a plot such as a Mesh plot or FilledBoundary plot, uniform density will be used. The results are print to the <b>Query results</b>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Chord Length Distribution</p></td>
<td>
<p>DB</p></td>
<td>
<p>The Chord Length Distribution query calculates a probability density function of chord length over a two or three dimensional object. Axially symmetric objects (RZ-meshes) are treated as 3D meshes and chords are calculated over the revolved, 3D object. A statistical approach, casting uniform density, random lines, is used. The result of this query is a curve, which is outputted as a separate file. This curve is a probability density function over length scale.

<td>
<p>Distance from Boundary</p></td>
<td>
<p></p></td>
<td>
<p>The Distance From Boundary query calculates how much mass is at a given distance away from the boundary of a shape. An important distinction for this query is that distance from the boundary (for a given point) is not defined as the shortest distance to the boundary, but simultaneously as all surrounding distances. Axially symmetric objects (RZ-meshes) are treated as 3D meshes and length scales are calculated over the revolved, 3D object. The implementation employs a statistical approach, with the casting of uniform density, random lines. The result of this query is a curve, which is outputted as a separate file. This curve contains the amount of mass as a function of length scale. Integrating the curve between P0 and P1 will give the total mass at distance between P0 and P1 (given the interpretation above). The name of the resulting file is printed to the <b>Query results</b>.</p></td>
</tr>

<td>
<p>L2Norm Between Curves</p></td>
<td>
<p>DB</p></td>
<td>

Axially symmetric objects (RZ-meshes) are treated as 3D meshes and length scales are calculated over the revolved, 3D object. The implementation employs a statistical approach, with the casting of uniform density, random lines. The result of this query is a curve, which is outputted as a separate file.
