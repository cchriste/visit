<h2>Restoring session</h2>
<p>
Restoring a VisIt session file deletes all plots, closes all databases, etc before VisIt reads the session file to get back to the state described in the session file. After restoring a session file, VisIt will look exactly like it did when the session file was saved. To restore a session file, click the <b>Restore session</b> option from the <b>Main Window's File </b>menu to open an <b>Open file</b> dialog. Choose a session file to open using the <b>Open file</b> dialog. Once you've chosen a file, VisIt restores the session using the selected session file. If you are on the Windows platform, you can double-click session files (.vses files) stored on your computer in order to directly open them with VisIt.
