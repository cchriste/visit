Many engineering simulation codes write a mesh for the first time state of the simulation and then write vector displacements for the mesh for subsequent time states. The Displace operator makes it possible to use the mesh and the time-varying vector field to observe the behavior of the mesh over time. The Displace operator provides a multiplier that can amplify the effects of the vector field on the mesh so slight changes in the vector field can be exaggerated. An example showing a mesh and a vector field, along with the results of the mesh displaced by the vector field is shown in Figure4-21.
