<h2>Changing the point size</h2>
<p>
Some databases scalar variables defined on meshes of topological dimension zero. When these point variables are 2D, VisIt draws them using small points that are colored by the value of the variable. When a point variable is 3D, VisIt draws it as a set of 3D cubes colored by the value of the variable. To control how large the points appear, change the point size attribute by typing a new number into the <b>Point size </b>text field. Larger point size values result in larger points in the visualization window. The point size can also be scaled by a scalar variable if you check the <b>Scale point size by variable</b> check box and select a new scalar variable from the <b>Variable </b>button. The value "default" must be replaced with the name of another scalar variable if you want VisIt to scale the points with a variable other than the one being plotted by the Pseudocolor plot.
