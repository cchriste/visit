<h2>Managing plots</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure1"></a><img src="../images/Plots/activeplotsarea.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 1</i></td></tr></table></center><br>To visualize your data, you will iteratively create and modify many plots until you achieve the end result. Since plots may be created and deleted many times, VisIt provides controls in its <b>Main Window</b> to handle these functions. The <b>Active plots area</b>, shown in figure, contains the controls for managing plots.
</p>
<p>
The most prominent feature of the <b>Active plots area</b>, the <b>Plot list</b><b>, </b>contains a list of the plots that are in the active visualization window. The entries in the plot list contain the index of the file used for the plot followed by the plot name and variable. Plot list entries change colors depending on the state of the plot. When plots are initially created, their plot list entries are green indicating that they are new and have not been submitted to the compute engine for processing. When a plot is being created on the compute engine, its plot list entry is yellow. When a plot has finished generating on the compute engine, its plot list entry turns black to indicate that the plot is done. If the compute engine cannot generate a plot, the plot's plot list entry turns red to indicate an error with the plot.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Plot list</b> displays more then just the names of the visualization window's plots. The <b>Plot list</b> also allows you to set the active plots, that is, those plots that can be modified. Highlighted plot entries are active.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Plot and Operator</b> menu, an important part of the <b>Active plots area</b>, contains the options that create new plots and open plot attribute windows.
