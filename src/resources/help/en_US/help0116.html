<h2>Opacity</h2>
<p>
The Subset plot's opacity can be changed globally as well as on a per subset basis. To change subset opacity, first select one or more subsets in the subset list and move the opacity slider next to the color button. Moving the opacity slider to the left makes the selected subsets more transparent and moving the slider to the right makes the selected subsets more opaque. To change the entire plot's opacity globally, use the <b>Opacity</b> slider near the bottom of the window.
