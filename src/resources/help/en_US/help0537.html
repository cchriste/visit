<h2>Setting batch queue options</h2>
<p>
Some compute environments such as large IBM computers schedule parallel jobs in batch queues. The <b>Engine option window</b> provides a few controls that are useful for batch queued systems. The first option is the number of nodes which determines the number of smaller portions of the computer that are allocated to a particular task. Typically the number of processors is evenly divisible by the number of nodes but the window allows you to specify the number of nodes such that not all processors within a node need be active. You can set the number of nodes, by typing a new number into the <b>Num nodes</b> text field or you can increment or decrement the number by clicking on the arrow buttons to the right of the text field. The second option is the bank which is a large collection of nodes from which nodes can be allocated. To change the bank, you can type a new bank name into the <b>Bank</b> text field. The final option that the window allows to be changed is the time limit. The time limit is an important piece of information to set because it can help to determine when the compute engine is scheduled to run. A smaller time limit can increase the likelihood that a task will be scheduled to run sooner than a longer running task. You can change the time limit by typing a new number of minutes into the <b>Time limit</b> text field.
