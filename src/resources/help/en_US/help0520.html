<h2>Providing additional command line options</h2>
<p>
The <b>Host Profile Window</b> allows you to provide additional command line options to the compute engine and database server through the <b>Additional options</b> text field. When you provide additional command line options, you should type them, separated by spaces, into the <b>Additional options</b> text field. Command line options influence how the compute engine and database server are executed. For more information on VisIt's command line options, see <b>Appendix A</b>. Most of the host profiles that are installed with VisIt specify the expected installation directory for VisIt so VisIt does not have to be in your path on remote computes.
