<h2>Changing GUI Orientation</h2>
<p>
By default, VisIt's <b>Main Window</b> appears as a vertical window to the left of the visualization windows. The default configuration often makes the best use of the display when its resolution is high enough. For displays that have less than 1280x1024 pixels, you might consider switching VisIt's window layout to a horizontal layout, which makes slightly better use of the display resolution.

The <b>Main Window's </b>position also changes relative to the visualization windows. Instead of being located to the left of the visualization windows, the <b>Main Window</b> is instead moved so it is on top of the visualization windows, which are resized to fit the new configuration. To change VisIt's GUI orientation, select either <b>Vertical</b> or <b>Horizontal</b> from the <b>Appearance Window</b>'s <b>GUI orientation</b> menu and click the <b>Apply</b> button. This will cause VisIt's windows to change to the appropriate configuration. figure shows VisIt's vertical layout and figure shows VisIt's horizontal layout.
