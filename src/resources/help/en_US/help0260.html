<h2>Adding a new vis window</h2>
<p>
You can add a new vis window in a few different ways, the first of which is by selecting the <b>Add</b> option from the <b>Main Window's Windows</b> menu. You can also click on the <b>Add window icon</b> in the vis window's <b>Toolbar</b> or you can select the <b>Add window</b> option from the <b>Windows</b> submenu in the vis window's <b>Popup menu</b> to add a new vis window. When you add a new window, it will be sized according to the window layout so if you have only a single, large vis window, the new vis window will also be large. You can change the window layout to shrink the vis windows so that they both fit on the screen. Vis windows are numbered 1 to 16 so the new window will have the first available number for which there is not already a window. If you have windows 1,2, and 4, vis window 3 would be created by adding a new window. Adding a new window also makes the new window the active window.
</p>
<p>
A new vis window can also be added by cloning the active window. You can clone the active window by selecting the Clone option from the <b>Main Window's Windows</b> menu or you can click the <b>Clone window icon</b> in the vis window's <b>Toolbar</b>. When you clone the active window, VisIt creates a new window as if you had clicked the Add option but it also copies the plots, annotations, and lighting from the active window so that the new window is identical in appearance to the active window. When plots are copied to the new cloned window, they have not yet been generated so their plot list entries in the <b>Plot list </b>are green. You can force the plots to be generated by clicking the <b>Draw</b> button in the <b>Main Window</b>.
