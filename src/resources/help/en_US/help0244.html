<h2>Saving movies</h2>
<p>
In addition to allowing you to save images of your visualization window for the current time state, VisIt also allows you to save movies and sets of images for your visualizations that vary over time. There are multiple methods for saving movies with VisIt. This section introduces the Save movie wizard and explains how to use it to create movies from within VisIt's GUI. The <b>Animation and Keyframing</b> chapter on page 261 will explain some auxiliary methods that can be used to create movies.

The <b>Save movie wizard's</b> purpose is to lead you through a set of simple questions that allow VisIt to gather the information required to create movies of your visualizations. For example, the <b>Save movie wizard</b> asks which image and movie formats you want to generate, where you want to store the movies, what you want to call the movies, etc. Each of these questions appears on a separate screen in the <b>Save movie wizard</b> and once you answer the question on the current screen, clicking the <b>Next</b> button advances you to the next screen. You can cancel saving a movie at any time by clicking on the <b>Cancel</b> button. If you advance to the last screen in the <b>Save movie wizard</b> then you have successfully provided all of the required information that VisIt needs to make your movie. Clicking the <b>Finish</b> button at that point invokes VisIt's movie-making script to make the movie. If you want to make subsequent movies, you can choose to use the settings for the movies that you just made or you can choose to create a new movie and provide new information.
