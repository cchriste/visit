<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 2.6.2 is primarily a

<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.6.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>A threading error that surfaced when running PySide applications using <i>-pysideviewer</i> was removed from the Python interface. The threading error could cause the PySide application to lock up. This happened mostly on Windows.</li>
<li>VisIt's <i>frontendlauncher</i> script was fixed so it can be launched from a symbolic link.</li>
<li>A memory error was corrected in the Silo database reader that sometimes caused plots that involved materials to fail.</li>
<li>Fixed the filter string for loading/saving Python expressions so that files matching the filter will be displayed.</li>
<li>The Gadget reader was fixed such that opening a large number of files in a virtual database no longer fails on reopen.</li>
<li>Fixed a viewer crash caused by pick when logical coords are selected for output.</li>
<li>Fixed some problems with Nameschemes in Silo multi-block objects including using relative paths to reference external arrays.</li>
<li>Fixed problems using build_visit to build Silo with Silo's Qt-dependenent Silex tool enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where <i>-nopty</i> was required to run client/server from clients running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 systems.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.6.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>A Python interpreter is now installed with VisIt when VisIt is built with Python support.</li>
<li>A number of changes were made to VisIt's <i>frontendlauncher</i> script in an attempt to resolve Python-related startup errors:
    <ul>
       <li>The shell and Python portions of the script have been separated, meaning that VisIt no longer needs to write temporary script files on startup.</li>
       <li>The shell portion of the script now attempts to locate a suitable Python interpreter within the current or most recent VisIt installations. If a suitable Python interpreter is located within VisIt's installations then that interpreter is used to execute VisIt's launch scripts. Otherwise, the system Python interpreter is used as before.</li>
       <li>The Python portion of the script checks the Python interpreter version and quits with an error message when Python 3 is detected.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
