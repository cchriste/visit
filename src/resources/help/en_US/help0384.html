<h2>Setting tick mark properties</h2>
<p>
The tick marks are small lines that are drawn along the edges of the 2D viewport. Tick marks can be drawn on a variety of axes by selecting a new option from the <b>Show tick marks </b>menu. Tick marks can also be drawn on the inside, outside, or both sides of the plot viewport by selecting a new option from the <b>Tick mark locations</b> menu in the <b>Annotation Window</b>.
</p>
<p>
Tick mark spacing is usually changed to best suite the plots in the visualization window but you can explicitly set the tick mark spacing by first unchecking the <b>Auto set ticks</b> check box and then typing new tick spacing values into the <b>Major tick minimum, Major tick maximum, Major tick spacing,</b> and <b>Minor tick spacing</b> text fields. The text fields on the left correspond to the horizontal axis while the rightmost text fields set the tick spacing for the vertical axis.
