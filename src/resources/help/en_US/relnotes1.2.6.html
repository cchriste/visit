enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.2.6</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Gradient and resampling operations have been drastically sped up for rectilinear grids. Both operations are over 100x faster.</li>
  <li>Pick can now distinguish between block-logical and domain-logical indices. The Pick window also has new controls to allow the user to select what is displayed.</li>
  <li>Expressions with multiple variables now support different centerings.</li>
  <li>The Minmax query now outputs the correct set names for the given SIL.</li>
  <li>Axis label scaling can now be set manually.</li>
  <li>The view window now understands xtrans, ytans, and zf commands.</li>
  <li>VisIt now provides a "recenter" expression that allows you to change the centering for a variable.</li>
  <li>VisIt now shows a hidden vis window when that vis window is made active.</li>
  <li>The Mili database reader plugin is now available on GPS at LLNL.</li>
  <li>The BoxLib database reader plugin is now available on AIX systems at LLNL.</li>
  <li>The mesh quality expressions, which are added to the scalar plots' variable menus, are now better organized.</li>
  <li>VisIt can now show the anchor points along a lineout.</li>   
</ul>

  <li>Lineout does more work than is necessary.</li>
  <li>Session files can produce visualizations with the wrong settings when VisIt finds a system config file.</li>
  <li>Restoring sessions repeatedly causes view problems and an eventual viewer crash.</li>
  <li>The File panel does not show new time states for a .visit file after reopening the file.</li>
  <li>You can't run VisIt in distributed mode to a remote machine that is protected by a firewall.</li>
  <li>The Onionpeel operator does not correctly recognize block-global coordinates.</li>
  <li>?The File panel does not show all time states for virtual databases that have more than one file per time state.</li>
  <li>avtPointToGlyphFilter does not work with cell data.</li>
  <li>If you specify an output directory for saved images, stereo images are not saved there.</li>
  <li>Sometimes there are extra tick marks on the 3d axis.</li>
  <li>Sometimes pieces of the 3d axes are corrupted.</li>
  <li>VisIt renders the current plots while restoring a session file.</li>
  <li>Navigation mode was not saved in a session file.</li>
  <li>Changing the "smooth data" toggle in the Volume plot attributes window should cause the plot to re-execute.</li>
  <li>VisIt's CLI uses the whole CPU while waiting for a calculation to complete.</li>
