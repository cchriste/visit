<h2>Default directory</h2>
<p>
By default, VisIt looks for files in the current directory. This is often useful in a UNIX<sup>TM</sup> environment where VisIt is launched from a command line shell in a directory where database files are likely to be located. When VisIt is set to look for files in the current directory, the <b>"current working directory"</b> check box is set. If all of your databases are located in a central directory that rarely changes, it is worthwhile to uncheck the check box, change directories to your data directory, and save settings so the next time VisIt runs, it will look for files in your data directory.
