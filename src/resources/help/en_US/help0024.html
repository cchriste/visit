<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure5"></a><img src="../images/WorkingWithFiles/simulation.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 5</i></td></tr></table></center><br>VisIt currently treats simulations as though they were ordinary files. When the VisIt simulation interface library is enabled in your application, it writes a special file with a <i>.sim1</i> extension to the <i>.visit/simulations</i> directory in your home directory. Each <i>.sim1</i> file encodes the time and date it was created into the file name so you can distinguish between multiple simulations that VisIt can potentially open. A <i>.sim1</i> file contains information that VisIt needs in order to connect via sockets to your simulation. If you want to connect to a simulation, you must select the <i>.sim1</i> files corrsponding to the simulations to which you want to connect and add them to the <b>Selected files list</b> (figure). Once you've done that, connecting to a simulation is the same as opening any other disk file.
