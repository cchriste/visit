<h2>Navigate mode</h2>
<p>
Navigate mode is VisIt lingo for moving and zooming-in on plots. When the vis window is in navigate mode, clicking the left mouse button and dragging with the mouse will perform an action that moves, rotates, or zooms the plot. The mouse motions used to rotate plots are shown in figure. You can translate plots by holding down the <i>Shift</i> key before left-clicking and dragging the plot. You zoom in on plots by clicking the middle button and moving the mouse up or down. Sometimes the controls are modified based on the interactor settings. For more information, look at the section on <i>Interactor settings</i>.
