<h2>Adding a keyframe</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure5"></a><img src="../images/Animation/keyframearea.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 5</i></td></tr></table></center><br>To add a keyframe, you must first have created some plots and put VisIt into keyframing mode by clicking the <b>Keyframing enabled</b> check box in the <b>Keyframing Window</b>. After you have plots and VisIt is in keyframing mode, you can add a keyframe by opening a plot's attribute window, changing settings, and clicking its <b>Apply</b> button. To set a keyframe for a later frame in the animation, move the <b>Keyframe time</b> slider, which is located under the <b>Keyframe area</b> (see figure), to a later time and change the plot attributes again. Each time you add a keyframe to the animation, a small black diamond, called a <b>Keyframe indicator</b>, will appear along the <b>Keyframe line</b> for the plot. When you play through the animation using any of VisIt's animation controls, the plot attributes are calculated for each animation frame and they are used to influence how the plots look when they appear in the vis window.
