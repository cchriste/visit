<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.3 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>  Each database with multiple time states now gets its own time slider 
that you can use to set the time independently for each database. This allows multiple, unrelated, time-varying databases to coexist in the same visualization window. When there are multiple time sliders, the "Active time slider" chooser appears above the animation slider in the SUI's main window. Select a different time slider if you want to change time states for that database.</p>
<p>   If you want to lock the plots from multiple databases together in time,
you can create a database correlation. A database correlation is a mapping that
relates the time states from one or more databases. There are currently 4
correlation methods: padded index, stretched index, time, cycle. Padded index
correlations choose the database in the correlation with the most time
states and repeat the last state from all shorter databases until they are
all the same length. A stretched index correlation also chooses the database
with the most time states but instead of repeating the last time state from
the shorter databases, their time states are stretched until all databases
in the correlation have the same length. That way, time states are repeated
in the middle of the correlation instead of at the end. Time correlations 
create a list of all times from all database time states and then create a
mapping of time states to match the times that are shown. Cycle correlations
work in the same way but use cycle instead of times.</p>
<p>  If you want to create a database correlation, open the Database correlation
list window in VisIt's Controls menu. Once you open the window, click the "New"
button to create a new correlation in a new correlation window. Once the
new correlation window appears, you can choose the name and correlation method
for the new database correlation. You can also add databases to the database
correlation. When you create a database correlation, VisIt creates a new time
slider for the new correlation and makes it the active time slider. When you
change the time slider for a database correlation to a new state, all plots
that have databases that are part of the database correlation are affected
and have their states updated according to the database correlation. You can
switch between time sliders at any time if you do not want to set the time
state using the database correlation's time slider. You can also delete or
alter database correlations. </p>
<p>   The Database correlation list window allows you to create or edit
database correlations but it can also be used to set the conditions under which
VisIt will automatically create database correlations. By default, VisIt will
prompt you to before automatically creating a new database correlation if
you add a plot from a database that has the same number of time states as
a plot that is already in the vis window. You can make VisIt never/always/sometimes
create new database correlations when adding plots. You can also set the 
default correlation method and whether you want to be prompted before the new
correlation is created. </p>
<p>   When you lock windows in time, VisIt attempts to create a database
correlation for databases in all of the locked windows. This ensures that when
you change the time slider in one window, it has meaning to also change it in
the locked windows.
</p>
</li>
<li>Some of VisIt's queries now support a "Time Query" button. When you click the "Time query" button instead of the "Query" button, VisIt calculates the query for all time states in the database and creates Curve plots using the calculated values. This feature lets you see behaviors over time. Use the "Query over time" options window in the Main window's Controls menu to set some of the options for the time query feature.</li>
<li>The File panel's Open button becomes Reopen after you open a database. If you then click on a database that you've previously opened , the Reopen button becomes the Activate button. When you activate a database, you make it the new active database from which new plots will be created.</li>
<li>The Preferences window has been modified so you can set the properties of the Main window's File panel. You can now turn off the selected files list. You can also now prevent VisIt from ever changing the highlighted file in the selected files list if you turn off the "Automatically highlight file" check box. If you don't like when VisIt automatically highlights the active file or time state for the active database, be sure to turn off that check box in the Preferences window and save your settings.</li>
<li>When the File panel's Selected files list is hidden, the "Active source" chooser appears above the plot list. The active source chooser lets you set the active source, which is the database from which all new plots will be created. All databases that you've previously opened are available in the active source chooser.</li>
<li>VisIt will now prompt you to select a host profile each time a compute engine is launched.</li>
<li>VisIt now recognizes the ".mkf" extension for Master Kull Files.</li>
<li>The SAMRAI database reader plugin is now built on gps and mcr.</li>
<li>The Exodus database reader plugin is now build on white and S.</li>
<li>The Exodus reader can now correctly report simulation time.</li>
<li>Parallel compute engine arguments supplied on the command line are now applied to all compute engine launches when the viewer is run in -nowin mode.</li>
<li>The "Surface area" query has now been renamed to: "3D Surface area" and "2D area".</li>
<li>All host profiles now set a batch timeout if they use the psub parallel launcher.</li>
<li>VisIt's compute engine now loads database plugins on demand so it is substantially quicker to launch, especially in parallel.</li>
<li>VisIt's compute engine depends on fewer libraries so it launches faster.</li>
<li>VisIt's GUI issues an informational message that tells you how to enable plugins.</li>
