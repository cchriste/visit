<h2>Changing the point size</h2>
<p>
Some databases contain point meshes, which are meshes of topological dimension zero. When the point mesh is 2D, VisIt draws it using small points. When the point mesh is 3D, VisIt draws its points as 3D cubes. To control how large the points appear, change the point size attribute by typing a new number into the <b>Point size </b>text field. Larger point size values result in larger points in the visualization window. The point size can also be scaled by a scalar variable if you check the <b>Scale point size by variable</b> check box and optionally select a variable name from the <b>Variable</b> button's menu. The initial value of "default" must be replaced with a valid scalar variable name in order for VisIt to scale the point size with a variable.
