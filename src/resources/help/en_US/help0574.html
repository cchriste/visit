<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>
The toolbar contains buttons that you can use to cycle forward and backward in the list of visited help pages. The <b>Back</b> button has an arrow icon that points to the left and the button changes the active help page to the last visited help page. The <b>Forward</b> button has an arrow icon that points to the right and it switches the help page to the page that was active before the <b>Back</b> button was clicked. If have not visited any help pages, both of these buttons are disabled. The toolbar also contains a <b>Home</b> button which has a house icon. The <b>Home</b> button displays the VisIt home page, which describes VisIt's features.
