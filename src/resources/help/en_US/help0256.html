<h2>Setting paper format</h2>
<p>
The <b>Printer Window</b> allows you to set the type of paper on which you will print. This helps VisIt determine how it should scale images when printing. Yo can set the size of the paper by choosing from the lower menu in the <b>Paper format</b> group located in the middle right of the <b>Printer Window</b>. You can also set the printed image orientation to <i>Portrait</i> or <i>Landscape</i> by choosing an option from the top menu in the Paper format group.
