<h2>Rendering Options Window</h2>
<p>
The <b>Rendering Options Window</b> (shown in figure) contains controls that allow you to set global options that affect how the plots in the active vis window are drawn and you can also look at information related to the performance of your graphics hardware. You can open the <b>Rendering Options Window</b> by selecting the <b>Rendering</b> option in the <b>Main Window's Preferences</b> menu. The window is divided vertically into two main areas. The top area, or <b>Options area</b>, contains controls that allow you to set rendering options which affect how your plots look in the vis window. Some topics related to how plots are drawn such as antialiasing, specular lighting, and shadows are covered in the <b>Making it Pretty</b> chapter. The bottom area, or <b>Information area</b>, displays information about how fast VisIt is able to draw graphics on your computer, as well as the size of the plots being drawn in terms of triangle count and spatial dimension
