<h2>Resampling onto a rectilinear grid</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure50"></a><img src="../images/Operators/resamplewindow.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 50</i></td></tr></table></center><br>Resampling a high resolution dataset onto a rectilinear grid is the most common use case for the Resample operator. When a Resample operator is applied to a plot, the Resample operator clips out any data values that are not within the operator's bounding box. For the data that remains inside the bounding box, the operator samples it using the user-specified numbers of samples for the X, Y, and Z dimensions. The bounding box is specified by entering new start and end values for each dimension. For example, if you want to change the locations sampled in the X dimension then you could type new floating point values into the <b>Resample operator attributes window's</b> <b>Start X</b> and <b>End X</b> text fields. The same pattern applies to changing the locations sampled in the Y and Z dimensions. One difference between resampling 2D and 3D datasets is that 3D datasets must have the <b>3D resampling</b> check box enabled to ensure that VisIt uses the user-specified Z-extents and number of samples in Z.

Samples for which there was no data in the original input dataset are provided with a default value that you can change by typing a new floating point number into the <b>Value for uncovered regions</b> text field.
