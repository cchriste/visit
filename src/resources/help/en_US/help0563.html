<h2>Changing surface representations</h2>

<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure16"></a><img src="../images/Preferences/surfacerep.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 16</i></td></tr></table></center><br>Sometimes when visualizing large or complex databases, drawing plots with all of their shaded surfaces can take too long to be interactive, even for fast graphics hardware. To combat this problem, VisIt provides an option that allows you to view all of the plots in the vis window as wireframe outlines or point clouds instead of as shaded surfaces (see figure). While being less visually informative, plots drawn as wireframe outlines or as clouds of points can still be useful for visualizations since you can do setup work like setting the view before switching back to a surface representation that is more costly to draw. You click the <b>Surfaces</b>, <b>Wireframe</b>, or <b>Points</b> radio buttons to change the surface representation used to draw plots.
