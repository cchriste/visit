<h2>Passwords</h2>
<p>
Sometimes when you try to access files on a remote computer, VisIt prompts you for a password by opening a <b>Password Window</b> (figure) . If you are prompted for a password, type your password into the window and click the <b>Ok</b> button. If the password window appears and you decide to abort the launch of the remote component, you can click the <b>Password Window's Cancel</b> button to stop the remote component from being launched.
</p>
<p>
VisIt uses <i>ssh</i> for authentication and you can set up ssh so that passwords are not required. This is called passwordless ssh and once it is set up for a computer, VisIt will no longer need to prompt for a password. More information about setting up passwordless ssh can be found in <b>Appendix B</b>.
