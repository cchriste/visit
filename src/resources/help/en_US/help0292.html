<h2>Engaging spin</h2>
<p>
Spin is a setting that makes plots spin after the user stops rotating them and it provides a nice, easy way to see the entire plot without having to actively rotate it. To spin a 3D plot, turn on the <b>Spin</b> option in the <b>Popup menu's Windows</b> menu and then rotate the plot as you would in navigate mode. The plot will continue to spin after you release the mouse buttons. You can also engage spin using the <b>Spin</b> option in the <b>Main Window's Windows</b> menu or by clicking the <b>Spin icon</b> in the vis window's <b>Toolbar</b>. You can stop plots from spinning by turning off spin.
