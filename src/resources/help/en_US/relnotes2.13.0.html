</ul>

<a name="General_features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 2.13</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Database read/export options that contain enums will now be presented with the string form of the enum via the cli.  Setting the option will accept an int or a valid string and print error messages if either is invalid for the option being set.</li>
  <li>The SeedMe window will now by default clear all forms when the window is closed.  The Settings tab has a new checkbox <i>Clear all tabs on close</i> to control this option.  If modified, the option will be saved in VisIt's config file when settings are saved.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Advanced_features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced features added in version 2.13</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Advanced Feature 1</li>
  <li>Advanced Feature 2</li>
</ul>

<a name="GUI_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes in GUI behavior for version 2.13</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>GUI Change 1</li>
  <li>GUI Change 2</li>
</ul>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 2.13</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>EnSight reader was modified to handle variables not defined on all parts.  Part descriptions are now used to fill out the SIL.  Particles supplied in measured files are now supported as a separate mesh.</li>
  <li>File Format 2</li>
</ul>

<a name="Plot_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's plots in version 2.13</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Boundary plot had unused attributes in support of Point glyphing removed: <i>pointSize, pointType, pointSizeVarEnabled, pointSizeVar, pointSizePixels</i>. No-longer-needed attributes <i>boundaryType</i> and <i>filledFlag</i> were also removed. Old python scripts, session and config files with these attributes set should still work.</li>
  <li>FilledBoundary plot had no-longer-needed attributes removed: <i>boundaryType, filledFlag</i>. Old python scripts, session and config files with these attributes set should still work.</li>
  <li>Subset plot had no-longer-needed attribute <i>filledFlag</i> removed. Old python scripts, session and config files with this attribute set should still work.</li>
  <li><b>Possible breaking change!</b> Legacy support for non-material (eg domains, levels) vars was removed from Boundary and FilledBoundary plots. Old session files and python scripts specifying non-material variables for Boundary or FilledBoundary plots will fail. Changing the plot type in scripts or session files to Subset should allow them to work.</li>
  <li><b>Possible breaking change!</b> Legacy support for material vars was removed from the Subset plot. Old session files and python scripts specifying material variables for Subset plot will fail. Changing the plot type to FilledBoundary should allow them to work.</li>
</ul>
<a name="Operator_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's operators in version 2.13</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Threshold operator was enhanced to allow users to input a list of ranges to threshold a single variable on. For example, to only select zones with values in the range 1 to 5 and 7 to 10, you would specify "1:5, 7:10".</li>
</ul>

<a name="Expression_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's expression language in version 2.13</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Expression Change 1</li>
  <li>Expression Change 2</li>
</ul>

<a name="Query_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's picks and queries in version 2.13</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The default for Queries that operate on either <i>Original</i> or <i>Actual</i> data has been changed from <i>Original</i> to <i>Actual</i>.  This makes them consistent with all the other queries that only operate on <i>Actual</i> data. Affected Queries include <i>Min</i>, <i>Max</i>, <i>MinMax</i>, <i>NumNodes</i>, <i>NumZones</i> and <i>Spatial Extents</i>. In the GUI, you will notice that the <i>Actual Data</i> button is the one activated by default for these queries, and from the cli, the <i>use_actual_data</i> parameter defaults to 1 if not set explicitly.  This will also affect QueryOverTime for any of these queries.</li>
  <li>Pick's error messaging was improved to prevent messages regarding expressions unrelated to the current Pick or the current problem it encountered.</li>
  <li>NodePick failure with certain datasets was fixed.</li>
  <li>Fixed the problem where NodePick of Sliced Boundary plot would place pick letter in wrong location.</li>
  <li>Accuracy and performance of picking on lines/line meshes in 3D has been improved.</li>
  <li>Fixed query-over-time when running in parallel to only create a single curve for each result.
  <li>Corrected a bug with the <i>XRay Image</i> query, where the data type for bov output was incorrectly set to float in the case where the intensities were double or integer.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Other bugs fixed in version 2.13</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VTK export options have been modified to more explicitly state the combination of Legacy+[Ascii/Binary], XML+[Ascii/Binary]</li>
  <li>Removed "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) rz network" from the list of network configurations to install when installing on Windows since that configuration only works when running VisIt directly on the rz machines.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Configuration_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Configuration changes in version 2.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Host profiles were removed for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories' Rzmerl and Rzzeus systems, which were retired.</li>
  <li>Host profiles for running client/server to machines at TACC were removed. Users should use VNC instead as described <a href=https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/STAMPEDE#vis>here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Build_features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Build features added in version 2.13</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Build_visit has been enhanced to support OpenSWR. OpenSWR is an Intel software renderer that is now part of Mesa. OpenSWR should not be enabled with mesa. To enable OpenSWR add the following flags "--llvm --openswr" to the command line. When you build visit with OpenSWR support it will use the Mesa llvmpipe renderer by default. To enable the OpenSWR renderer you will need to set the GALLIUM_DRIVER environment variable to swr (e.g. "setenv GALLIUM_DRIVER swr"). When VisIt runs with OpenSWR it will print AVX or AVX2 to the terminal depending on the type of Intel CPU you are running on.</li>
  <li>Build Feature 2</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 2.13</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>PySide 2 has been added to build_visit when Qt 5 is chosen.</li>
  <li>Build_visit has been updated to build CMake version 3.8.1.</li>
  <li>Build_visit no longer has a gui option.</li>
  <li>The spelling of the CHECK_THIRDPARTY_SATISFIED cmake macro has been corrected (CHECK_THIRDPARTY_SATISIFED to CHECK_THIRDPARTY_SATISFIED).</li>
