<h2>Limits</h2>
<p>
The <b>Volume plot attributes window</b> provides controls for setting the limits of the variable being plotted. Limits are artificial minima or maxima that are specified by the user. Setting the limits to a smaller range of values than present in the database cause the plot's colors to be distributed among a smaller range of values, resulting in a plot with more color variety.
</p>
<p>
You set the limits for the variable being plotted in the <b>Color area</b> of the window. To set the limits are set by first clicking the <b>Min</b> or <b>Max</b> check box next to the <b>Min</b> or <b>Max</b> text field. Clicking a check box enables a text field into which you can type a new minimum or maximum value.
</p>
<p>
Like VisIt's other plots that map scalar values to colors, the Volume plot allows for the data values to be scaled using Linear, Log, and Skew functions. To select a scaling function other than linear where values in the data range are mapped 1:1 to values in the color range, click on the <b>Log10</b> or <b>Skew</b> radio buttons.
