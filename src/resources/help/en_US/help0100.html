<h2>Selecting a variable</h2>
<p>
Three of the Scatter plot's four input variables can be set in the <b>Scatter plot attributes window</b>. The first input variable cannot be changed from within the <b>Scatter plot attributes window</b> because that is the default variable used by the plot. If you want to change the first input variable, you can use the <b>Variables</b> menu under the <b>Plot list</b>. If you want to select a different variable for any of the other input variables, you would first click on the input variable's tab and then you would select a new variable by making a selection from the tab's <b>Variable</b> button. Note that any combination of nodal and cell-centered variables can be chosen. The Scatter plot will recenter any input variables whose centering does not match the first input variable's centering.
