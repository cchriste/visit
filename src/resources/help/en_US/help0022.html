<h2>Refreshing the file list</h2>
<p>
Scientific simulations often write out new data files as they run. The <b>Refresh</b> button makes VisIt re-read the current directory to pick up any new files added by a running simulation. If the active source is a virtual database whose definition was changed by refreshing the file list, then VisIt will close and reopen the active source so information about new time states is made available.
