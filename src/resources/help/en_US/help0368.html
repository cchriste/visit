<h2>Setting curve attributes</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure18"></a><img src="../images/Quantitative/curveplotwindow.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 18</i></td></tr></table></center><br>Curve plots have a few options that can be set to alter their appearance. You can set the curve's line style, which can be solid, dotted, dashed, or dash-dotted, by making a selection from the <b>Line Style</b> menu in the <b>Curve plot attributes window</b> (figure). If the Curve plot is difficult to see in the visualization window, try increasing the line thickness by making a selection from the <b>Line Width</b> menu. You can change the curve's color, by clicking on the <b>Color</b> button and selecting a new color from the <b>Popup color </b>menu. If you don't want the curve to have labels, you can turn them off by unchecking the <b>Labels</b> check box. Finally, you can make Curve plots display a small point glyph at each data point along the curve if you check the <b>Points</b> check box and set a point size in the <b>Point size</b> text field.
