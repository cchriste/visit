<h2>Choosing an export file format</h2>
<p>
The <b>Export Database Windo</b>w lists the names of the database reader plugins that can also write data back into their native file formats. A small handful of the total number of database plugins currently support this feature but in the future most formats will support this capability more fully, making VisIt not only a powerful visualization tool but a powerful database conversion tool.

The Silo file format can safely export any type of data that you may want to export. If you want to export data to other applications and the data must be stored in an ASCII file that contains columns of data, you might want to choose the Xmdv file format. If you want to choose a specific database plugin to export your data files, make a selection from the <b>File Type</b> menu shown in Figure figure.
