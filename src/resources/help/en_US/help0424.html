<h2>Light color and brightness</h2>
<p>
VisIt allows lights to have colors as well as brightnesses. Colored lighting can produce interesting effects that may be desirable for presentations. To change the light color, click on the light <b>Color</b> button and select a new color from the <b>Popup color menu</b>. Once a color is picked, you can also set the brightness for the light. The brightness is essentially a knob that allows you to dim the light. If the brightness is set completely to the right then the light will have exactly the color that was picked for it. If the brightness is not set to full intensity then the light will be dimmer. You can set the brightness by adjusting the <b>Brightness</b> slider in the <b>Lighting Window</b>.
