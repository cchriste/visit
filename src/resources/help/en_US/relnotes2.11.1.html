</ul>

<a name="Enhancements"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.11.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt was ported to and installed on Los Alamos National Laboratories' Trinity system. A host profile was added for running in client/server mode from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</li>
  <li>Several of the ASCII-based database readers (PlainText, Curve2D, Lines, Rect, etc.), were upgraded to support
      on-the-fly decompression via gzstream class. This means VisIt can directly read a gzip'd input file in these
      formats. Previously, this would have been handled through VisIt's ZipWrapper database reader but this new
      apporach is simpler and more efficient for simple ASCII-based files. This capability does not currently extend
      to ASCII-based formats that are read via other libraries such as VTK, MFEM, etc. In addition, as part of this
      enhancement VisIt's Save Window feature can now save gzip'd compressed curve formats. In this case, the
      quality slider selects the gzip level in the range [1..9]. Some of the ASCII Export Database formats were
      also enhanced.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 2.11.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Xdmf configuration in build_visit was modified to correctly set XDMF_SYSTEM_ZLIB and XDMF_SYSTEM_LIBXML2 to ON, since we use the vtk versions during the build.</li>
  <li></li>
