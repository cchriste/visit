<h2>Annotation Colors</h2>
<p>
Colors are very important in a visualization since they help to determine how easy it is to read annotations. VisIt provides a tab in the <b>Annotation Window</b>, shown in figure, specifically devoted to choosing annotation colors. The <b>Colors</b> tab contains controls to set the background and foreground for the visualization window which, in turn, sets the colors used for annotations. The <b>Colors</b> tab also provides controls for more advanced background colors called gradients which are colors that bleed into each other.
