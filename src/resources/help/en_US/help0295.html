<h2>Clearing plots from all windows</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure20"></a><img src="../images/VisualizationWindows/clearmenu.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 20</i></td></tr></table></center><br>Sometimes it is useful to clear all plots from the vis window. Clearing plots from the vis window does not delete the plots but instead deletes their computed geometry and returns them to the new state so they appear green in the <b>Plot list</b>. An example of when you might want to clear plots is when you change material interface reconstruction options since changing them requires a plot to be regenerated. Rather than deleting plots that existed before changing the material interface reconstruction parameters, you can clear the plots and force them to be completely regenerated by clearing the plots.
