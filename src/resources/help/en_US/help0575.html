<h2>Changing font size</h2>
<p>
The toolbar contains two buttons that allow you to change the font size used to display online help. The <b>Larger font </b>button is distinguished by a large capital <i>`A'</i> and a small triangle which points up. When the <b>Larger font</b> button is clicked, the font size is increased and the active help page is redrawn with the larger font. The <b>Smaller font</b> button looks similar to the <b>Larger font</b> button except that its icon's triangle points down and its <i>`A'</i> is smaller. The <b>Smaller font</b> button decreases the font size and immediately redraws the active help page using the new smaller font.
