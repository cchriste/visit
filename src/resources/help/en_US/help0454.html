<h2>Keyframing mode</h2>
<p>
To create a keyframe animation, you must first open the <b>Keyframing Window</b> and check the <b>Keyframing enabled</b> check box. When VisIt is in keyframing mode, a keyframe is created for the active animation state each time you set plot or operator attributes and time is set using the <b>Animation</b> time slider. The <b>Animation</b> time slider is a special time slider that is made active when you enter keyframing mode and the animation frame can only be set using it. Changing time using any other time slider results in a new database state keyframe instead of changing the animation frame.
</p>
<p>
If you have created plots before entering keyframing mode, VisIt converts them into plots that can be keyframed when you enter keyframing mode. When you leave keyframing mode, extra keyframing attributes associated with plots are deleted, the animation containing the plots reverts to a flipbook animation, and the Animation time slider is no longer accessible.
