<a name="Advanced_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced features added in version 2.10</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>A new <i>VisItExportDatabaseWithOptions()</i> function was added to Libsim. The function is like <i>VisItExportDatabase()</i> except that it takes a 4th argument that lets the simulation pass an option list. An option list is a set of key/value pairs that lets the simulation provide write options for the selected writer plug-in.
<p><b>Example:</b><br>
<font color="#6666dd"><code><pre>
/* Write binary VTK data. */
VisIt_OptionList_alloc(&opts);
VisIt_OptionList_setValueB(opts, "Binary format", 1);
VisItExportDatabaseWithOptions(filebase, "VTK_1.0", vars, opts);
</pre></code></font></p>
 </p>
 </li>

  <li><p>VisIt's export mechanism has been enhanced with support for <i>"Write Groups"</i>. When writing out data on HPC systems independent file writes often provides the best performance up to around a few thousand MPI ranks. After that, file system limitations begin to emerge and it makes sense to coordinate access to the parallel file system to get overall faster performance. Write groups are an optional feature provided in the <b>Export</b> window that enable VisIt to partition its MPI ranks into smaller groups of user-specified size. The MPI ranks within each group then coordinate their access to the file system. This can reduce contention and improve overall performance. On systems such as NERSC's edison machine, partitioning a VisIt job into groups of 48-96 processors can greatly improve export performance. The optimal size of the write group depends on the size of the VisIt job and the amount of data being written.</p>
<p>
Some file format plug-ins can tell VisIt that they want geometry from various MPI ranks aggregated on rank 0 so a single file can be written. At scale, writing aggregating geometry to a single MPI rank is extremely costly and VisIt risks running out of memory. For formats that aggregate data, write groups improve scalability by aggregating data onto the leader rank of each write group, which then writes out the data to the file format. This will result in more files but exports will be faster.
</p>
<p>The write group functionality is available by passing an option list to Libsim's <i>VisItExportDatabaseWithOptions()</i> function.<br>
<p><b>Example:</b><br>
<font color="#6666dd"><code><pre>
visit_handle vars = VISIT_INVALID_HANDLE, opts = VISIT_INVALID_HANDLE;
VisIt_NameList_alloc(&vars);
VisIt_NameList_addName(vars, "pressure");

/* Construct write groups of 48 processors. */
VisIt_OptionList_alloc(&opts);
VisIt_OptionList_setValueI(opts, VISIT_EXPORT_WRITE_USING_GROUPS, 1);
VisIt_OptionList_setValueI(opts, VISIT_EXPORT_GROUP_SIZE, 48);

VisItExportDatabaseWithOptions(filebase, exportFormat, vars, opts);

VisIt_NameList_free(vars);
VisIt_OptionList_free(opts);
</pre></code></font></p>
 </li>

  <li>Libsim's VisIt_VariableData object was extended so you can optionally supply it with multiple data arrays, each representing a separate component of data. This enhancement permits VisIt to accept non-contiguous simulation data without first converting that data to a contiguous representation. This is a particularly useful feature for array-of-structure data structures and will reduce Libsim's memory overhead.
Data arrays using the new <i>setArrayData</i> functions can have one or more components, which have their own base address and associated offset and stride. All of the previous <i>setData</i> functions continue to work and remain the preferred method for passing contiguous data to Libsim. The flexibility offered by the new <i>setArrayData</i> functions allows simulation data to be used directly (zero-copy) in situations that would previously have required a copy of the data.<br>

<p><b>Structure of Arrays Example:</b><br>
<font color="#6666dd"><code><pre>
#define MAX_PART 100

typedef struct
{
    double x,y,z;
    double mass;
} Particle;

Particle P[MAX_PART];

/* Expose Array of Structure x,y,z values as a single VariableData object. */
visit_handle coordinates = VISIT_INVALID_HANDLE;
VisIt_VariableData_alloc(&coordinates);
VisIt_VariableData_setArrayDat/wikiaD(coordinates, 0, VISIT_OWNER_SIM, MAX_PART, 0, sizeof(Particle), (void *)&P[0].x);
VisIt_VariableData_setArrayDataD(coordinates, 1, VISIT_OWNER_SIM, MAX_PART, 0, sizeof(Particle), (void *)&P[0].y);
VisIt_VariableData_setArrayDataD(coordinates, 2, VISIT_OWNER_SIM, MAX_PART, 0, sizeof(Particle), (void *)&P[0].z);

/* Expose Array of Structures mass array as a single VariableData object. */
visit_handle mass = VISIT_INVALID_HANDLE;
VisIt_VariableData_alloc(&mass);
VisIt_VariableData_setArrayDataD(mass, 0, VISIT_OWNER_SIM, MAX_PART, 0, sizeof(Particle), (void *)&P[0].mass);
</pre></code></font>

In addition, this new functionality can be used to create the desired interleaved view of coordinates that are stored in separate arrays.
<br><br>
<b>Interleaved Coordinates Example:</b><br>
<font color="#6666dd"><code><pre>
#define NX 100
#define NY 100
#define NZ 100
int dims[] = {NX, NY, NZ};
double x[NZ][NY][NX], y[NZ][NY][NX], z[NZ][NY][NX];

/* Expose x,y,z values as a single VariableData object. */
visit_handle coordinates = VISIT_INVALID_HANDLE;
VisIt_VariableData_alloc(&coordinates);
VisIt_VariableData_setArrayDataD(coordinates, 0, VISIT_OWNER_SIM, NX*NY*NZ, 0, sizeof(double), (void *)x);
VisIt_VariableData_setArrayDataD(coordinates, 1, VISIT_OWNER_SIM, NX*NY*NZ, 0, sizeof(double), (void *)y);
VisIt_VariableData_setArrayDataD(coordinates, 2, VISIT_OWNER_SIM, NX*NY*NZ, 0, sizeof(double), (void *)z);

visit_handle mesh = VISIT_INVALID_HANDLE;
VisIt_CurvilinearMesh_alloc(&mesh);
VisIt_CurvilinearMesh_setCoords3(mesh, dims, coordinates);
</pre></code></font>
<br>
Data passed via the new <i>setDataArray</i> functions are supported for mesh coordinates and variables. Certain other use such as specifying unstructured mesh connectivity are not currently permitted.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>Libsim's Fortran bindings were enhanced so the <i>visitsetmpicommunicator</i> function passes an MPI communicator by its integer handle. Thank you to William T. Jones for this improvement.</li>
  <li>Libsim's runtime library was improved so when it is used in batch mode, it loads color tables broadcast from rank 0 to lessen the demands on the file system. This reduces Libsim initialization time.</li>
  <li>Libsim's runtime library was enhanced so it can be initialized with a set of user-specified plot and operator plugins. Restricting the number of plot and operator plugins is useful in batch mode and it can dramatically improve initialization time. Plugins are specified using <i>-plotplugins</i> and <i>-operatorplugins</i> command line arguments passed to the <i>VisItSetOptions()</i> function. Each argument takes a comma-separated list of plugin names or id's.<br>
<p><b>Example:</b><br>
<font color="#6666dd"><code><pre>
VisItSetOptions("-plotplugins Mesh,Pseudocolor -operatorplugins Isosurface,Slice,Threshold");
</pre></code></font></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<a name="GUI_Changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes in GUI behavior for version 2.10</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The 2D Line annotation interface was enhanced to allow the line color to be the same as the foreground color, and to provide a style setting.</li>
  <li>A 3D Line annotation object has been added.</li>
  <li>Session files can be saved and loaded from a remote host.</li>
  <li>The <i>Set save options</i> window was overhauled. The <i>Standard Save</i> and <i>Advanced Multi-Window Save</i> tabs have been replaced with an <i>Aspect ratio and resolution</i> section and a <i>Multi-window save</i> section. The <i>Aspect ratio</i>, <i>Width</i>, <i>Height</i> and <i>Screen capture</i> controls have been moved into the <i>Aspect ratio and resolution</i> section. The tiled and advanced multi-window save controls have been moved into the <i>Multi-window save</i> section. The <i>Stereo</i> control has been moved into the <i>Format options</i> section.</li>
</ul>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 2.10</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The PLOT3D reader has been enhanced in the following ways:
  <ul>
      <li><i>Auto-detect</i> the format options normally specified by the <i>.vp3d meta file</i> or via <i>Read options.</i>  Auto-detection works for most binary files, but not for ascii. It is always on, and if successful, will override the values specified in the <i>.vp3d meta file</i> or <i>Read options.</i>  If not successful, the reader will fallback to use the other settings.</li>
      <li>Support time-series solution files, specified in the form 'somefile*.q', (where '*' matches a number specifing the timestate) or 'somefile??3?.q'.  Use the '?' form to sub-select from the time series. The q filename in this form can be used in the <i>.vp3d meta file</i>, or via <i>Read Options.</i>  The '.q' extension is the default. If you want VisIt to parse the time value from the filenames, turn off the new <i>"Solution Time field accurate"</i> read option.</li>
      <li>Support non-record based Fortran binary files. <i>(Auto detection of options may fail).</i></li>
      <li>Additional Read options were added for specifying Gas constants <i>R</i> and <i>Gamma</i> used in calculating functions like <i>Temperature, Pressure, Enthalpy and Entropy.</i> The defaults used are 1.0 and 1.4 respectively.</li>
      <li>The <a href="http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Plot3D">wiki</a> page was updated with the latest information for reading PLOT3D files.</li>
  </ul> 
  <li>The Nek5000 reader had an issue with #std 8 data files (double size data). The data dimensions would be read wrong. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>VisIt can now read <i>.vtm</i> VTK multiblock files.  Exporting multi-block data as VTK XML format will now write out <i>.vtm</i> files instead of <i>.visit</i> for grouping the indidividual blocks.</li>
  <li>The Pixie plugin now supports ghost zones (thanks to Jean Favre).</li>
  <li>VisIt can more reliably export data to Tecplot format in parallel.</li>
  <li>VisIt can export XYZ format data in parallel.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Tecplot reader can now export datasets that use other than single floating point precision.</li>
  <li>The Mili reader now returns the time information so that it can be displayed in the database legend, the time slider, and queries over time.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Plot_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's plots in version 2.10</font></b></p>

<a name="Operator_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's operators in version 2.10</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>A bug was fixed with several of the operators, where VisIt would give an error if the operator generated any empty domains. These include the CoordSwap, EllipsoidSlice, Extrude, Isovolume, SphereSlice and ThreeSlice operators.</li>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Other bugs fixed in version 2.10</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>A bug was corrected that could cause VisIt to hang initializing network connections when connecting from a Windows system to a Linux system with ssh forwarding over a gateway.</li>
  <li>2D Line annotation has been fixed so that adding arrowheads does not make the line disappear.</li>
  <li>A bug that caused a warning message to pop up when adding Image Annotation objects has been fixed.</li>
  <li>2D axis titles have been fixed so that a color other than foreground color can be used.</li>
  <li>Libsim's internal buffer for retrieving the user's environment was fixed at 10Kb, which is not large enough to accommodate some users' environments. The environment retrieval code has been rewritten to handle arbitrary sizes.</li>
  <li>The splatting render mode in the Volume plot was corrected so it would no longer change graphics settings in a way that could corrupt the rendering of other plots such as Pseudocolor.</li>
  <li>Calling the Libsim function <i>VisItExportDatabase()</i> from a batch-only simulation would silently fail to export files for file format writers that provided database options (e.g. the VTK writer and Silo writers). This fix ensures that those file formats work for export from batch simulations.</li>
  <li>The VTK reader was serving up invalid time values for files that did not have time.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed with the NamedSelection and SmoothPolyData filters, where VisIt would give an error if the filter generated any empty domains.</li>
  <li>Fixed a case where VisIt's Recenter expression could SEGV if it encountered some domains with zero points and/or zero cells.</li>
  <li>The internal launcher now adds unknown arguments before the "-s script_name" argument and not between the script name and the script arguments.</li>
  <li>The advanced multi-window image save capability was modified to initialize the background to white.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Configuration_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Configuration changes in version 2.10</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The LLNL RZ and CZ only host profile options were removed from visit-install since it is confusing to users and is only useful when installing VisIt on the LLNL RZ and CZ networks, which is only done by developers. The LLNL RZ only host profile option was removed from the Windows installer since that is also confusing to users and isn't useful to anyone.</li>
