<h2>Setting the save file name</h2>
<p>
To set the file name that will be used to save files, type a file name into the <b>Filename</b> text field. The file name that you use may contain a path to a directory where you want to write the saved files. If no path is specified, the saved files are written to the directory from which VisIt was launched. A file extension appropriate for the type of file being generated is automatically appended to the file name. For example, a <i>BMP</i> file will have a <i>".bmp"</i> extension, while a <i>JPEG</i> file will have a <i>".jpeg"</i> extension, and so on.
</p>
<p>
The file name that VisIt uses to save visualizations is based on the specified file name, the file format, and also the family toggle setting. The family toggle setting is set by checking the <b>Family</b> check box towards the lower left part of the <b>Save Window</b>. The family toggle setting allows you to save series of files that all have essentially the same name except for a number that is appended to the file name. The number increases by one each time an image is saved. If the family toggle setting is on then a file named <i>"visit"</i> of type <i>TIFF</i> will save out as <i>"visit0000.tif"</i>. If the family toggle setting is off, the file will save as <i>"visit.tif"</i>.
