<p><b><font size="4">Configuration changes in version 2.8.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>A host profile was added for LLNL's <i>Surface</i> system.</li>
<li>A host profile was added for LLNL's <i>Rzgpu</i> system.</li>
<li>The host profile for LLNL's <i>Edge</i> system was deleted.</li>
<li>The default bank was changed from "bbronze" to "wbronze" for all the hosts in the <i>LLNL closed network</i> configuration.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.8.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>A node ordering issue for quadratic elements in Exodus files was corrected.</li>
<li>The internal launcher was modified so that by default it does not pass -ppn to mpiexec and mpirun when launching a parallel job. If the user needs to have the internal launcher pass -ppn to those commands then they will need to override that behavior in a custom launcher.</li>
<li>Lineouts that do not intersect the plot no longer issue a 'No input' error message for each successive lineout. The previous behavior of issuing a 'yielded no data' status message for only the lineouts that do not intersect a plot has been restored.</li>
<li>Corrected an issue with blocks in subset plots not being correctly outlined when the wireframe option is selected.</li> 
<li>Corrected an issue where pseudocolor plots of nodal variables defined on structured multi block meshes sometimes crashed the compute engine.</li>
<li>Corrected an issue generating structured ghost data which could cause Filled Boundary plot of AMR mesh to crash compute engine.</li>
<li>The VisIt launching script was modified so that arguments that it adds to the argument list are added at the beginning of the list instead of the end of the list so that argument passing for scripts works properly.</li>
<li>VisIt now uses significantly less memory when processing CSG meshes with many regions. In one instance, a subset plot of a CSG mesh consisting of about 36000 spheres that was using over 250 gigabytes is now using about half a gigabyte.</li>
<li>VisIt no longer crashes discretizing CSG meshes with the multi pass method when the number of boundaries in a region exceeds an internal limit. It now issues a warning message and tries the uniform discretization method.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Enhancements"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.8.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The zonetype expression now produces labels that are 3 characters long. It also supports most of VTK element types.</li>
<li>The XRay Image query now supports specifying the image view with the full generality of the 3d view for plots. The new view parameters currently can only be specified through the Python scripting interface. An example of their usage is:<pre>params = dict(output_type="png", divide_emis_by_absorb=1,<pre>focus=(0., 0., 0.), view_up=(0., 1., 0.), normal=(0., 0., 1.),<pre>view_angle=30., parallel_scale = 10.,<pre>near_plane = -20., far_plane = 20.,<pre>image_pan=(0., 0.), image_zoom = 1.,<pre>perspective = 1, image_size=(300, 300),<pre>vars=("abs", "emis"))<pre>Query("XRay Image", params)</li>
<li>Multi-file Exodus files were broken in 2.8.1 and are fixed again in 2.8.2.</li>
<li>Automatic format detection of Exodus files was improved by adding *.ex.#.# and variants as extension patterns for Exodus files.</li>
<li>Exodus plugin was enhanced to support meshes with arbitrary polyhedral elements.</li>
<li>Exodus plugin was enhanced to support global node and element numbers.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 2.8.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The NERSC custom launcher was modified so that the internal launcher will pass -ppn to the mpiexec and mpirun commands when launching parallel jobs.</li>
</ul>
