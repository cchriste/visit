<h2>Group number</h2>
<p>
Some databases are composed of multiple groups of meshes, which are often called groups. The <b>Index select operator attributes window</b> calls these groups of meshes groups. The Index select operator can be used to examine parts of a group of meshes by clicking the <b>Groups</b> radio button and typing a group number into the <b>Group</b> text field.
