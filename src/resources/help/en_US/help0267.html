<h2>Using vis windows</h2>
<p>
The first thing to know about using a vis window is how to change window modes. A window mode is a state in which the vis window behaves in a specialized manner. There are four window modes: Navigate, Zoom, Lineout, and Pick. Vis windows are in navigate mode by default. This means that most mouse actions are used to move, rotate, or zoom-in on the plots that the vis window displays. Each vis window has a <b>Popup menu</b> that can be activated by clicking the right mouse button while the mouse is inside of the vis window. The<b> Popup menu</b> contains options that can put the vis window into other modes and perform other common operations. To put the vis window into another window mode, open the <b>Popup menu</b>, select <b>Mode</b> and then select one of the four window modes. You can also change the window mode using the vis window's <b>Toolbar</b>, which has buttons to set the window mode. You can find out more about the <b>Popup menu</b> and <b>Toolbar</b> later in this chapter.
