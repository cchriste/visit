<h2>Supported File Types</h2>
<p>
VisIt can create visualizations from databases that are stored in many types of underlying file formats. VisIt has a database reader for each supported file format and the database reader is a plugin that reads the data from the input file and imports it into VisIt. If your data format is not listed in Table1, "File formats supported by VisIt," on page24 then you can first translate your data into a format that VisIt can read (e.g. Silo, VTK, etc.) or you can create a new database reader plugin for VisIt. For more information on developing a database reader plugin, refer to the <i>Getting Data Into VisIt</i> manual or send an e-mail inquiry to visit-users@elist.ornl.gov.
