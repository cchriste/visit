<h2>Compute Engine Window</h2>

<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure9"></a><img src="../images/RemoteVisualization/enginewindow.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 9</i></td></tr></table></center><br>You can open the <b>Compute Engine Window</b>, shown in figure, by selecting the <b>Compute engines</b> option from the <b>Main Window's File</b> menu. The main purpose of the <b>Compute Engine Window</b> is to display the progress of a compute engine as it completes a task. The window has two status bars. The top status bar indicates how much progress has been made in the overall task. The bottom status bar indicates that compute engine's progress through the current processing stage. The window also provides buttons for interrupting and closing compute engines, as well as an <b>Engine Information area</b> that indicates how many processors the engine uses and its style of load balancing.
