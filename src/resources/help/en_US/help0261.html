<h2>Deleting a vis window</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure2"></a><img src="../images/VisualizationWindows/closebutton.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 2</i></td></tr></table></center><br>There are four ways to delete a vis window. The first way is to select the <b>Delete</b> option from the <b>Main Window's Window menu</b>. When you delete a window in this manner, the active window gets deleted and VisIt makes the window with the smallest number the new active window. The second way to delete a window is to click on the <b>close window button</b> in the window decorations provided by the windowing system. The window decorations' appearance varies based on the platform and windowing system used to run VisIt, but the button used to close windows is commonly a button with an X in it. An example of a <b>close window button</b> is shown in figure.

The third way to delete a vis window is to click on the <b>Delete window icon</b> in the vis window's <b>Toolbar</b>. The fourth way to delete a vis window is to use the <b>Delete</b> option in the vis window's <b>Popup menu</b>. When you use the <b>Toolbar</b> or the <b>Popup menu</b> to delete a window, the window does not need to be the active window as when other controls are used.
