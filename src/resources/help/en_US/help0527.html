<h2>Setting the default bank</h2>
<p>
Some computers, if they are large enough, have scheduling systems that break up the number of processors into banks, which are usually reserved for particular projects. Users who contribute to a project take processors from their default bank of processors. By default, VisIt uses environment variables to get your default bank when submitting a parallel job to the batch system. If you want to override those settings, you can click the <b>Default Bank</b> check box to turn it on and then type your desired bank into the text field next to the check box.
