<h2>Setting the axis title</h2>
<p>
When VisIt creates a new Curve plot, after having calculated a query over time, the horizontal axis label is labeled with the database cycles. If you prefer to think about time in terms of time state or simulation time then you can change the axis label by clicking one of the following radio buttons in the <b>Query Over Time Window</b>: <b>Cycle</b>, <b>Time</b>, <b>Timestep</b>.
