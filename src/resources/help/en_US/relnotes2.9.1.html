<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.9.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The meta data server no longer crashes when it attempts to open a Silo file with empty multivar variables.</li>
  <li>Pick of expression variable that requires pipeline re-execution no longer causes an engine crash/hang in parallel.</li>
  <li>VTK Mapper has been updated to use a Log-scale, if selected, for texture coordinates and scaling when applying color using textures.</li>
  <li>Scatter Plot now supports double-precision input.</li>
  <li>Picking on plot with CoordSwap operator will no longer trigger Pipeline re-executions unless something else in the pipeline requires it.</li>
  <li>Nek5000 data files can now be opened correctly on Windows.</li>
  <li>OnionPeel on a Subset Plot of AMR data has been fixed.</li>
  <li>PFLOTRAN reader no longer causes the engine to crash when reading vector data.</li>
  <li>Threshold operator attributes dialog has been updated to display small min/max field values correctly</li>
  <li>The color-using-textures rendering preference is now preserved when settings are saved.</li>
  <li>The Data-Level Comparsion wizard now sets the variable-type of the expression being created.</li>
  <li>The 3D tab in the Annotations window has been modified so that the bounding box settings can be modified even when the axes portion is turned off.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed where Plot/Operator windows accepting doubles as input would truncate and/or round numbers being entered, thus possibly causing loss of significant digits.  Occurred generally for very small numbers.</li>
  <li>Fixed a glitch with the Expression creator window, where text could be parsed as html, eg &lt;P&gt; became new paragraph.</li>
  <li>Created a generic ExchangeVector method to call the correct Exchange*Vector method based on the underlying data type during ghost zone communication.</li>
