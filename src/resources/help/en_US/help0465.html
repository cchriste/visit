<h2>Scripting</h2>
<p>
Scripting is an alternate method of producing animations that can have the simplicity of flipbook animations with the flexibility of keyframing. Scripting animations is more difficult than other methods because you have to script each event by writing a Python or Java program to control VisIt's viewer. One clear strength of this method is that it is very reproducible and can be used to generate animation frames in a batch computing environment. For in-depth information about writing Python scripts for Visit, consult the <i>Visit Python Interface</i> document.
