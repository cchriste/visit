<h2>Changing colors</h2>
<p>
The main portion of the <b>Subset plot attributes window</b>, also known as the <b>Subset colors area</b>, is devoted to setting subset colors. The <b>Subset colors area</b> contains a list of subset names with an associated subset color. Subset plot colors can be assigned three different ways, the first of which uses a color table. A color table is a named palette of colors that you can customize to suite your needs. When the Subset plot uses a color table to color subsets, it selects colors that are evenly spaced through the color table based on the number of subsets. For example, if you have three subsets and you are coloring them using the "xray" color table, the Subset plot picks three colors out of the color table so your levels are colored black, gray, and white. To color a Subset plot with a color table, click on the <b>Color table radio button</b> and choose a color table from the <b>Color table menu</b> to right of the <b>Color table radio button</b>.

<p>
If you want all subsets to be the same color, click the <b>Single</b> radio button at the top of the <b>Subset plot attributes window</b> and select a new color from the <b>Popup color menu</b> that is activated by clicking on the <b>Single color button</b> . The opacity slider next to the <b>Single color button</b> sets the opacity for the single color.
</p>
<p>
Clicking the <b>Multiple</b> radio button causes each subset to be a different, user-specified color. By default, multiple colors are set using the colors of the discrete color table that is active when the Subset plot is created. To change the color for any of the subsets, select one or more subsets from the list of subsets and click on the <b>Color button</b> to the right of the <b>Multiple</b> radio button and select a new color from the <b>Popup color menu</b>. To change the opacity for a subset, move <b>Multiple</b> opacity slider to the left to make the subset more transparent or move the slider to the right to make the subset more opaque.
