<h2>Simplifying heavily mixed cells</h2>
<p>
VisIt provides the <b>Simplify heavily mixed cells</b> check box in the <b>Material Reconstruction Options Window</b> so you can tell VisIt to throw away information materials that have low volume fractions. When you tell VisIt to omit these materials, VisIt will use less memory and will also finish MIR faster because fewer materials have to be considered. The <b>Simplify heavily mixed cells</b> check box is especially useful for databases where most of the cells are mixed or where there are many cells that contain tens of materials. When you tell VisIt to simplify heavily mixed cells, you can tell VisIt how many of the top materials to keep from each cell by entering a new number of materials into the <b>Maximum materials per zone</b> text field. By keeping the N top materials, VisIt will be sure to preserve the features that are contributed by the most dominant materials.
