<h2>File panel</h2>
<p>
The <b>File panel</b>, near the top of the <b>Main Window,</b> displays the files in the <b>Selected files list</b> and contains controls for opening files and playing animations. The <b>File panel</b> always tries to display the <b>Selected files list</b> in the most intuitive manner. If all of the selected files come from the same directory on the local machine, the <b>File panel</b> will display the selected files in a simple list like the one shown in figure.

Directories are identified with a folder icon and they cannot be opened for visualization. Files have no icons; instead they have a number next to them that indicates their index in the <b>Selected files list</b>. The file number is used in the <b>Plot list</b> to identify the file used by the plot. The file tree is always represented using the fewest possible number of nodes to avoid having to click through levels of empty directories. Displaying the <b>Selected files list</b> in tree form makes it easier to distinguish the directory from which files come. This view of the <b>Selected files list</b> is shown in figure.
