<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.12.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Pick window wouldn't update the number of tabs displayed if picks were performed after changing number of tabs, but before 'Apply' was clicked.</li>
  <li>Fixed reading of numpy files on Windows.</li>
  <li>Fixed the issue with expressions involving multiple matvf functions using the same material name.</li>
  <li>Fixed query-over-time bug where in certain instances it would yield different results than a manual change-time-state-then-query.  In particular, for Boundary plots or when an Isosurface operator were used.</li>
  <li>The Silo plugin was adjusted to prevent the plugin from searching for the first non-empty sub-block on namescheme'd multi-block objects for which block-level empty objects were not written. As specified in previous release notes, such Silo files are considered <b>invalid</b>. Now, the Silo plugin will enforce this.</b>
</ul>

<a name="Enhancements"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.12.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>Parallel interactive pdebug</i> host profile for Jadeita at Lawrence Livermore National Laboriatory was modified to set the number of nodes and the time limit.</li>
  <li>The <i>Parallel interactive pdebug</i> host profile for Agate at Lawrence Livermore National Laboriatory was modified to set the time limit.</li>
  <li>Improved support for more general kinds of NBLOCK format strings in ANSYS reader.</li>
  <li>Host profiles were added for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboriatories' Rztopaz system.</li>
  <li>Some changes were made to improve GUI performance on databases with large numbers of variables. One of the effects of this change is that expressions which are normally automatically created by VisIt can be disabled. If this happens, you will be presented with a warning message that it has occurred and some actions you may take, if desired, to override it. We believe this will impact very few users.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 2.12.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Build_visit was modified to no longer apply a patch to Python when using the Intel compiler since the patch is now included in the version of Python we are using.</li>
  <li>Build_visit was modified to always set the rpath when building Python, not just when using the gcc compiler.</li>
</ul>
