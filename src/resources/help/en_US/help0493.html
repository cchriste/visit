<h2>Deleting a database correlation</h2>
<p>
Database correlations are automatically deleted when you close a database that you are not using anymore provided that the closed database is not an input database to any database correlation except for that database's trivial database correlation. You can delete non-trivial database correlations that you have created by highlighting a database correlation in the <b>Correlation</b> list in the <b>Database Correlation Window</b> and clicking the <b>Delete</b> button to the left of the <b>Correlation</b> list. When you delete a database correlation, the new active time slider will be set to the active database's time slider if the active database has more than one time state. Otherwise, the new active time slider, if any, will be set to the time slider for the first source that has more than one time state.
