<h2>Setting the file type</h2>
<p>
You set the file type by making a selection from the <b>File type</b> menu. You can choose from image file types or geometry file types. Note that some areas of the <b>Save Window</b> become enabled for certain file types.
</p>
<p>
Choosing <i>JPEG</i> format files enables the <b>Quality</b> slider and the <b>Progressive</b> check box. These controls allow you to specify the desired degree of quality in the resulting JPEG images. A lower quality setting results in blockier images that fit into smaller files. The progressive setting stores the <i>JPEG</i> images in such a way that they progressively refine as they are downloaded and displayed by Web browsers.
</p>
<p>
Choosing <i>TIFF</i> format files enables the <b>Compression type</b> combo box. The available compression types are: <i>None, PackBits, JPEG,</i> and <i>Deflate</i>. When compression is enabled for <i>TIFF</i> files, they are smaller than they would be without compression.
</p>
<p>
Choosing <i>STL</i> or <i>VTK</i> file formats saves visualizations as geometry files instead of images and also enables the <b>Binary</b> check box. The <b>Binary</b> check box tells these formats to write their geometry data as binary data files instead of human-readable ASCII text files. In general, files written with the binary option are smaller and faster to load than their non-binary counterparts.
