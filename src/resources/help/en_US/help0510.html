<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>
It is important to have VisIt in your default search path instead of specifying the absolute path to VisIt when starting it. This isn't as important when you run VisIt locally, but VisIt may not run properly in distributed mode if it isn't in your default search path on remote machines. If you regularly run VisIt using the network configurations provided for LLNL computers then VisIt will have host profiles, which are sets of information that tell VisIt how to launch its components on a remote computer. The provided host profiles have special options that tell the remote computer where it can expect to find the installed version of VisIt so it is not required to be in your path. If you did not opt to install the provided network configurations or if you are at a site that requires other network configurations then you will probably not have host profiles by default and it will be necessary for you to add VisIt to your path on the remote computer. You can add VisIt to your default search path on UNIX<sup>TM</sup> systems by editing the initialization file for your command line shell.
