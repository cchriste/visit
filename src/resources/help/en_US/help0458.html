<h2>Adding a view keyframe</h2>
<p>
In addition to being able to add keyframes for plot attributes, operator attributes, and database states, you can also set view keyframes so you can create sophisticated fly-bys of your data. To create a view keyframe, you must interactively change the view in the vis window using the mouse or specify an exact view in the <b>View Window</b>. Once the view is where you want it for the active animation frame, open the <b>View Window</b> and click the <b>Make camera keyframe from view</b> button on the <b>Advanced</b> tab in order to make a view keyframe. Once the view keyframe has been added, a keyframe indicator will be drawn in the <b>Keyframing Window</b>.
</p>
<p>
VisIt will not use view keyframes by default when you are in keyframing mode because it can be disruptive for VisIt to set the view while you are still adding view keyframes. Once you are satisfied with your view keyframes, click the <b>Copy view from camera</b> button on the <b>Advanced</b> tab in the <b>View Window</b> in order to allow VisIt to set the view using the view keyframes when you change animation frames.
