<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.13.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Modified the query over time to store the results in double precision instead of single precision.</li>
  <li>Modified the VTK Reader to ensure material scalars in multi-block datasets are read correctly.</li>
  <li>For Windows platform, VisIt will now display an error message if VISITSSH defined, but does not point to an executable, and if a parallel engine is requested but mpiexec.exe cannot be found.</li>
  <li>Fixed the issue with the ScatterPlot Setup Wizard populating the variable menus from a previous database.</li>
  <li>Fixed the thresholding for point meshes.</li>
  <li>Fixed crash performing a lineout when -dump issued on command line.</li>
  <li>VisIt's viewer was unnecessarily creating text labels that would likely not be used unless using a ParallelCoordinates plot. For Subset plots with large numbers of domains, this caused the viewer to use many gigabytes of memory even when scalable rendering was used.</li>
  <li>Fixed crash performing a time-query when Curve plot is disabled. An error message will now be issued, and the query will not be performed.</li>
  <li>Fixed build_visit build of Qt with -no-openssl on Fedora.</li>
  <li>Set MetadataIsTimeVarying in exported Silo databases by fiat. This is a pre-caution to ensure we handle exported data correctly in cases where metadata really is time-varying and probably a minimal performance hit in cases where its not necessary.</li>
  <li>Fixed crash opening certain netcdf-4 files on Windows.</li>
  <li>Fix crashes when any single block has number of nodes/zones or tuples x number of components that exceeds INT_MAX.<li>
  <li>Fix Save Window compression options so that only those options appropriate to currently selected format are enabled for selection.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the active window selector in the main window so that it now displays more than a single digit if necessary.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem running PythonFilters in parallel on Windows.</li>
  <li>Fixed hang starting VisIt 2.13.x on Windows VM.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Enhancements"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.13.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced the SPCTH reader to process a list of MTMD files as one MTMD file.</li>
  <li>Updated the <i>parallel interactive pdebug</i> host profile for LLNL <i>cab</i> machine to handle job launching changes on the machine.</li>
  <li>Updated the <i>parallel viz</i> host profile for the LANL <i>trinity</i> machine to handle job launching changes on the machine.</li>
  <li>Enhanced Pixie plugin to read datasets with more than INT_MAX nodes/zones.</li>
  <li>Default compression method for Save Window was changed from PackBits to None.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 2.13.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Modified build_visit to pass the zlib directory information to the configure command for hdf5 when -zlib was specified on the command line.</li>
  <li>Modified bv_pyside.sh to patch pyside2 that removes the conditional collecting of the Multimedia, WebEngineWidget, and WebKit modules.</li>
  <li>Fixed the QWT make install symlink error for OSX.</li>
  <li>Fixed the PySide2 and Shiboken2 library naming issue for OSX.</li>
  <li>Changed build_visit to build Qt in silent mode by default. Added the --no-qt-silent argument to build_visit that disables building Qt in silent mode.</li>
  <li>Changed when default variable units are set on the viewer, in order that plot plugins can override the default values in their CustomizeBehavior method.</li>
  <li>Upgraded numpy from 1.11.2 to 1.14.1.</li>
</ul>
