<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.13.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Modified query over time to store the results in double precision instead of single precision.</li>
  <li>Modified the VTK Reader to ensure material scalars in multi-block datasets are read correctly.</li>
  <li>Modified VisIt to display an error message on Windows if VISITSSH is defined, but does not point to an executable, and if a parallel engine is requested but mpiexec.exe cannot be found.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with the ScatterPlot Setup Wizard populating the variable menus from a previous database.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with the Threshold operator thresholding point meshes.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where VisIt would crash when performing a lineout when -dump was specified on the command line.</li>
  <li>Enhanced VisIt's viewer to address a performance issue where it unnecessarily created text labels that would likely not be used unless displaying a ParallelCoordinates plot. For Subset plots with large numbers of domains, this caused the viewer to use many gigabytes of memory even when scalable rendering was used.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where VisIt would crash performing a time-query when the Curve plot was disabled. An error message will now be issued, and the query will not be performed.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with build_visit with the building of Qt with -no-openssl specified on the command line on Fedora systems.</li>
  <li>Modified the exporting of data to Silo files to always set the MetadataIsTimeVarying attribute to ensure VisIt handles exported data correctly in cases where the metadata is time-varying. This will probably result in a minimal performance degradation in cases where its not necessary.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where VisIt would crash opening certain NetCDF-4 files on Windows.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where VisIt would crash when the number of nodes or zones or tuples times the number of components exceeds INT_MAX in a single block.<li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with the Save Window compression options so that only those options appropriate to the currently selected format are enabled for selection.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with the active window selector in the main window so that it now displays more than a single digit if necessary.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with running Python filters in parallel on Windows.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where VisIt would hang on start up when running on a Windows VM.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with Python filters failing on Windows 8, 10.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where the VisIt metadata server would crash when it encounterd a Silo file with a multimesh that was invalid, such as when the number of blocks specified was zero.</li>
  <li>Modified VisIt so that crash session files created by any running VisIt process are correctly ignored by any additional VisIt processes that are launched.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Enhancements"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.13.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced the SPCTH reader to process a list of MTMD files as one MTMD file.</li>
  <li>Modified the <i>parallel interactive pdebug</i> host profile for the LLNL <i>cab</i> machine to handle job launching changes on the machine.</li>
  <li>Modified the <i>parallel viz</i> host profile for the LANL <i>trinity</i> machine to handle job launching changes on the machine.</li>
  <li>Enhanced the Pixie reader to read datasets with more than INT_MAX nodes or zones.</li>
  <li>Changed the default compression method for saving windows from PackBits to None.</li>
  <li>Improved the performance of VisIt when populating file lists from directories with large numbers of entries.<li>
  <li>Modified VisIt to save crash session files for a specific VisIt process. The user can choose which crash session file to restore if multiple ones exist.<li>
  <li>Enhanced VisIt to select between chaos 5 and toss 3 executables on LLNL systems based on the machine name instead of the environment variable SYS_TYPE. Some users didn't have the SYS_TYPE environment variable set causing the previous logic to fail in some instances.</li>
  <li>Removed the host profiles for the LLNL <i>rzgpu</i> machine.</li>
  <li>Added host profiles for the LLNL <i>rzhasgpu</i> machine.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 2.13.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Modified build_visit to pass the zlib directory information to the configure command for hdf5 when -zlib was specified on the command line.</li>
  <li>Modified build_visit to patch pyside2 to remove the conditional collecting of the Multimedia, WebEngineWidget, and WebKit modules.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with the creation of a QWT symbolic link on OSX.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with the naming of the PySide2 and Shiboken2 libraries on OSX.</li>
  <li>Modified build_visit to build Qt in silent mode by default. Additionally, build_visit was modified to allow specifying <i>--no-qt-silent</i> on the command line to disable building Qt in silent mode.</li>
  <li>Changed the location where the default variables are set in the viewer so that plot plugins can override the default values in their CustomizeBehavior method.</li>
  <li>Upgraded Numpy from version 1.11.2 to 1.14.1.</li>
  <li>Enhanced the Python CLI to make it possible to the control visibility of annotation objects during their creation with an additional argument in the CreateAnnotationObject() method.</li>
  <li>Modified <i>Make package</i> so that it no longer includes any directories named <i>icons</i>. Previously, this resulted in a couple of invalid symbolic links being added to the distribution file.</li>
  <li>Upgraded Uintah from version 2.1.0 to 2.5.0 beta.</li>
  <li>Upgraded GDAL from version 1.10.0 to 2.2.4.</li>
  <li>Upgraded Conduit from version 0.3.0 to 0.3.1.</li>
  <li>Modified build_visit to patch BoxLib so that it would compile with newer versions of GCC.</li>
