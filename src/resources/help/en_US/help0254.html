<h2>Setting the printer destination</h2>
<p>
You use the printer destination to tell VisIt where your print your file. You have the option of printing to a network printer or a file. If you want to print to a network printer, select the <b>Print to printer</b> radio button and choose the name of the printer from the list of available network printers. The list of printers is read from your system settings and should be up-to-date. If you want to print to a file, select the <b>Print to file</b> radio button and type a valid file name into the file text field. You can also click on the <b>Browse</b> button to select a directory in which to write the <i>PostScript</i> file.
