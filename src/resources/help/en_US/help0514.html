<h2>Creating a new host profile</h2>
<p>
You click the <b>New profile</b> button to create a new host profile based on the selected host profile. If no host profile exists or if no host profile is selected, the new host profile contains reasonable default values. In any case, the host profile has a default name that you can change to make the new host profile more memorable. If the host profile is for a computer for which there are no other host profiles, a tab is created with the name of the new computer and the new host profile is added to the new tab.
