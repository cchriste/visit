Since species are part of the SIL, you can use the <b>Subset Window</b> (see figure) to turn off species. To access the list of species, select the Species category under the whole mesh. Once the Species category is clicked, the second pane in the <b>Subset Window</b> is populated with the species for all materials. Turn off the species that you don't want to look at by clicking off the check box next to the name of the species subset. When you apply your changes, the values for the Species variable are recalculated to include only the mass fractions for the species that are still turned on.
