<h2>Posting windows by default</h2>
<p>
When you use one of VisIt's menus to activate another VisIt postable window, such as a plot attributes window, the window manager is free to show the window wherever it likes. When you are using VisIt on a large display where the windows might pop up very far away from VisIt's <b>Main Window</b>, it is sometimes convenient to make sure that windows that can be posted to the <b>Notepad</b> area are initially posted to the <b>Notepad</b> area instead of popping up wherever the window manager puts them. To make windows post to the <b>Notepad</b> area by default when they are shown, click the <b>Post windows when shown</b> check box.
