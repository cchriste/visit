<a name="General_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 2.8</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt's Export mechanism has been enhanced so that all active plots in the plot list are considered for export. The current implementation will create numbered files with one file per plot, though this leaves some room for future improvement.</li>
  <li>VisIt now features a database plugin that enables VisIt to export <i>FieldView XDB</i> extract files for subsequent analysis in Intelligent Light's commercial post-processing software, FieldView.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Export mechanism has been enhanced so that all time states in a dataset can be exported. Click the <i>"Export all time states"</i> check box in the Export window to enable exporting all time states.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Advanced_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced features added in version 2.8</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Libsim was enhanced so simulations can expose global node and cell ids for unstructured meshes.</li>
  <li>VisIt's database plugin API and load balancer were enhanced so database plugins can return different domain decompositions for multidomain meshes. This feature enables libsim-instrumented simulations to more easily return their domain to processor mapping in the event that there are multiple multi-domain meshes that each have different domain decompositions.</li>
  <li>VisIt's CLI now provides a <i>GetEngineProperties()</i> function that returns engine properties. This makes it easier to query engines and simulations to determine their number of processors.</li>
</ul>

<a name="GUI_Changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes in GUI behavior for version 2.8</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt's Export window can use spaces or commas as delimiters for the variable list. This permits export of variables that contain spaces in their names via the GUI.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Export window can now display license strings from database plugins that provide license information. The license is displayed just before exporting the active plots to the database format.</li>
  <li>The color table window now has a toggle that allows grouping of color tables by a category name.  This will affect how the table names appear in this window as well as ColorTable buttons for Plot Attribute windows (like Pseudocolor).  By default, VisIt's tables will be under the <i>'Standard'</i> category, while personal tables will be <i>'UserDefined'</i>.  Category names may be changed, and a text edit is provided in the ColorTable window when grouping is enabled. If VisIt only loads its standard tables, and the category names have not been changed, then the grouping toggle will have no effect other than to make the category name text-edit available.  If you change the category name for <i>Standard</i> tables, saving your settings will preserve the new naming across VisIt sessions.  For <i>UserDefined</i> tables, color tables must be re-exported to pick up changes in category.</li>
</ul>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 2.8</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>An enhanced version of the AMR reader was added.</li>
  <li>A reader for parallel Velodyne files was added.</li>
  <li>VisIt was updated to Silo 4.10. The Silo plugin will no longer build against all previous releases of Silo. It now requires 4.10.</li>
  <li>Silo plugin supports namescheme'd multi-block objects with empty Silo objects replacing the "EMPTY" keyword convention. It is no longer necessary for data producers to use the DBOPT_MB_REPR_BLOCK_IDX option.</li>
  <li>For more information regarding Silo 4.10, please see <a href="https://visitbugs.ornl.gov/news/5">these notes</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="Plot_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's plots in version 2.8</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<a name="Operator_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's operators version in 2.8</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>A new option was added to the OnionPeel operator that can make the operator deliver results related to the currently plotted mesh instead of the original mesh. This may be helpful in the case of arbitrary polhyedral data, where zones have been split and one would like to examine how the splits occurred.  The default behavior for OnionPeel has been (and continues to be) to honor the original mesh as far as possible.  To modify it to use the actual mesh: from the gui, change 'Honor original mesh' to 'Honor actual mesh';  from the cli, change 'honorOriginalMesh' from 1 to 0. </li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<a name="Expression_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's expression language in version 2.8</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Expressions can now accept double-precision sized float constants.</li>
  <li>The new array_sum expression computes the sum of all elements in an array and returns it as scalar.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<a name="Query_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's picks and queries in version 2.8</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>All queries now provide Xml results.</li>
  <li>Queries called from the CLI have been modified to always return a value. The type of returned object is user-settable, and consists of 3 options:
  <ul>
      <li>String (default): <i>Same as calling GetQueryOutputString()</i> </li>
      <li>Value: <i>Same as calling GetQueryOutputValue()</i></li>
      <li>Object: <i>Same as calling GetQueryOutputObject()</i></li>
  </ul>
    The options are chosen via new methods: <i>SetQueryOutputToString()</i>, <i>SetQueryOutputToValue()</i>, or <i>SetQueryOutputToObject()</i>.  The option remains valid for all queries during the current VisIt session, unless another call to <i>SetQueryOutputToXXX</i> is made. Calls to <i>GetQueryOutputXXX</i> can still be made, regardless of the query return type chosen.  <b>NOTE:</b> The old query output messages are hereby suppressed when making a Query via the CLI. 
  </li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Other bugs fixed in version 2.8</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Export Database window will no longer allow file-system browsing when exporting to remote host.</li>
  <li>Fixed bad behavior with updating Curve Plot options when 'Auto apply' selected and multiple Curve plots are drawn.</li>
  <li>Fixed command recording for QueryOverTimeAttributes.</li>
  <li>Fixed tesselation bug that was preventing the polyhedral simulation example from rendering correctly.</li>
  <li>Fixed a memory leak in unstructured grid ghost cell generation based on global node ids.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem preventing ghost cells from being generated for 2D unstructured cell types. This fixes a bug where wireframe FilledBoundary plots were showing wireframes along domain boundaries.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem-sized memory leak in the Clip operator after processing domains that resulted in zero clipped geometry.</li>
  <li>Fixed a pick bug where global ids would sometimes not be reported correctly.</li>
  <li>Fixed crash with Silo data and material subsetted variables.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where export attributes were not saved to VisIt's config file.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the OnionPeel operator wasn't working correctly for arbitrary polyhedral data.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Config_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to configuration files in version 2.8</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 2.8</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt has been enhanced to handle database readers that can provide 2D multi resolution versions of the data. When 2D multi resolution is enabled, the avtMultiresFilter adds a multi resolution data selection to the contract that contains the view frustum and a desired cell size. The reader then needs to return a data set that covers the frustum and has a cell size smaller than the desired cell size assuming that the mesh covers the extents and has cells smaller than the desired size. The reader also needs to add to the contract the actual frustum covered and the actual cell size returned. A working example of a reader that supports multi resolution data selection was added. It is the MRTest reader and is built when specifying -DVISIT_BUILD_ALL_PLUGINS=1 with cmake.</li>
  <li>The plot information in the contract is now printed to the <i>-dump</i> web pages.</li>
  <li>The avtDatabaseWriter class has been refactored so that the export process is much more configurable:
    <ul>
       <li>The expansion of the <i>default</i> variable is now plugin controlled.</li>
       <li>Exporting is more careful about not re-executing the pipeline unless it needs to re-execute to fetch new data.</li>
       <li>Geometry can be consolidated on rank 0,combined by labels, or left alone. This simplifies the creation of readers that require geometry to be written on rank 0.</li>
       <li>Plots can alter the contract as part of export.</li>
       <li>The database writer now knows the names of the plot being exported so it can change its behavior, if desired.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Filters have been improved so they add some filter metadata that at least contains the name of the operator that was applied. Text representations of the operator attributes can also be added to the filter metadata. Filter metadata can be used during database export to make meaningful names for the visualizations being exported.</li>
  <li>The database plugin API has been extended so that plugins can return license strings.</li>
  <li>One can now specify which plugins VisIt should build via CMake variables VISIT_SELECTED_type_PLUGINS, where 'type' is one of: DATABASE, PLOT, OPERATOR.  Setting the var can be accomplished in the config-site file via a SET command: <pre>SET(VISIT_SELECTED_DATABASE_PLUGINS Silo VTK H5Part)</pre> or via the cmake command line with a ';' separated list: <pre>-DVISIT_SELECTED_DATABASE_PLUGINS:STRING="Silo;VTK;H5Part"</pre>If this is var is not set for a particular plugin type, then plugins are built according to normal rules.  <i>Spelling of the plugin must match its directory name.</i></li>
