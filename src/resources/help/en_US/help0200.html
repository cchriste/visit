Scientific simulations often rely on symmetry so they only need to simulate part of the problem. When creating a visualization, most users want to see the entire object that was simulated. This often involves reflecting the database geometry to create the full geometry of the simulated object. VisIt's Reflect operator can be applied to both 2D and 3D databases and can reflect them across one or more plot axes. An example of the Reflect operator is shown in figure.
