<h2>Interactor settings</h2>
<p>
Some window modes such as Zoom mode and Navigate mode have certain interactor properties that you can set. Interactor properties influence how user interaction is fed to the controls in the different window modes. For example, you can set zoom interactor settings that clamp a zoom rectangle to a square or fill the viewport when zooming. VisIt provides the <b>Interactors window</b> so you can set properties for window modes that have interactor properties. The <b>Interactors window</b> is shown in figure.
