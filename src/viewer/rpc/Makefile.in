#    Made it create a shared library.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 10:31:46 PDT 2001
#    Changed library building: the LIB targets has no extension, and
#    either LIBSINGLETARGETS or LIBMULTITARGETS must be included
#    in addition to TARGETS depending on whether the library is build
#    from object files in one directory or multiple subdirectories.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 12 14:30:09 PDT 2002
#    Unified include directories.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Aug 13 16:00:16 PST 2003
#    I removed -lrpc, which is a library that we've not built for a long time.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Apr 26 09:07:26 PDT 2004
#    I added a couple more libraries to get prebinding working on MacOS X.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Apr 15 10:29:41 PDT 2005
#    I added PostponedAction.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Feb 12 09:12:56 PDT 2007
#    I added ViewerMethdods and ViewerState.
#
#    Thomas R. Treadway, Thu Jul 26 16:19:55 PDT 2007
#    Added a couple more libraries for MacOS X.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Tue Jun 30 20:02:20 MDT 2009
