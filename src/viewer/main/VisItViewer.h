// Class: VisItViewer
//
// Purpose:
//   This class provides an interface for controlling VisIt's viewer as an
//   embedded component in another application. There is limited access to 
//   various viewer pieces to ensure they remain encapsulated.
//
// Notes:

// Programmer: Brad Whitlock

//
// Modifications:
//    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Oct 16 19:29:12 EDT 2008
//    Added a flag for whether or not ProcessCommandLine should force 
//    the identical version.  It's necessary for new viewer-apps but
//    might confuse VisIt-proper's smart versioning.
//   
//    Brad Whitlock, Tue Apr 14 14:23:53 PDT 2009
//    Added ViewerProperties.
