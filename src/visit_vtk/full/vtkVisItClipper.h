// ****************************************************************************
//  Class:  vtkVisItClipper
//
//  Purpose:
//    Clips a dataset using an implicit function.  This is a wholesale
//    replacement for the internal VTK clipper for structured, rectilinear,
//    and unstructured datasets with three topological dimensions and cell
//    types that are a part of the normal zoo.
//
//  Programmer:  Jeremy Meredith
//  Creation:    August 11, 2003
//
//  Modifications:
//    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jan 30 16:15:50 PST 2004
//    Added scalar array and scalar range for isovolume.
//
//    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Feb 16 19:08:16 PST 2004
//    Added PolyData support.
//
//    Jeremy Meredith, Wed May  5 13:06:14 PDT 2004
//    Renamed without the "3D" because I also made it support 2D.
//    Changed it to a single cutoff for scalars to make the math more robust.
//
//    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Aug 29 13:43:56 EDT 2006
//    Added support for forcing removal of entire cells instead of clipping.
