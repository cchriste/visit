// .NAME vtkLineoutFilter - 
// .SECTION Description
// vtkLineoutFilter is a filter object that applies a probe filter to
// the input.  The probe filter output is transformed into x-y pairs
// (vertices), with x representing the distance along the probe-line
// and y the interpolated scalar value at that point. 
//
// Points determined as 'invalid' by the probe filter
// are not included in the output.
//
