// .NAME vtkUniqueFeatureEdges - extract boundary, non-manifold, and/or 
// sharp edges from polygonal data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkUniqueFeatureEdges is a filter to extract special types of edges from
// input polygonal data. These edges are either 1) boundary (used by 
// one polygon) or a line cell; 2) non-manifold (used by three or more 
// polygons); 3) feature edges (edges used by two triangles and whose
// dihedral angle > FeatureAngle); or 4) manifold edges (edges used by
// exactly two polygons). 

// .SECTION Caveats
// This is almost exactly like vtkFeatureEdges with the exceptions:
//     (1)  there is no edge 'coloring'. 
//     (2)  vtkEdgeTable is used to ensure no duplicate edges are inserted. 
//     (3)  ghostCells compared to UpdateGhostLevel instead of 0. 

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkFeatureVertices
