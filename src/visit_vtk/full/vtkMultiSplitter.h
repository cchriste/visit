//  Class:  vtkMultiSplitter
//
//  Purpose:
//    Splits a rectilinear dataset using multiple implicit functions,
//    tagging output cells as it splits, and later allowing extraction
//    of various region sets as whole data sets.
//
//  Note: Copied largely from vtkVisItSplitter

//  Creation:    July 23, 2012

//    I converted the class to use vtkCSGFixedLengthBitField instead of
//    FixedLengthBitField.
