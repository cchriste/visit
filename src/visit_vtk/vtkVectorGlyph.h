// .NAME vtkVectorGlyph -- Creates the appropriate glyph for a vector.
//
// .SECTION Description
// Creates the poly data to be used by a glyph filter for vector data.  This
// is a line with a head.  The head is not capped.  The size of the head may
// be set and the head may be turned off completely.
