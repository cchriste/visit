<h2><p>Showing selected files</h2></p>
<p>The <b>File pane</b>l is no longer required to switch between open databases so you can now turn off the <b>Selected files</b> list and its associated <b>Open</b>, <b>ReOpen</b>, <b>Activate</b>, <b>Replace</b>, and <b>Overlay</b> buttons to free up more space in the <b>Main Window</b> for other controls such as the <b>Plot list</b> or <b>Notepad</b> area. If you want to hide the <b>Selected files</b> list, open the <b>Preferences Window</b> and click off the <b>Show selected files</b> check box. When the <b>Selected files</b> list is hidden, an additional <b>Sources</b> combo box appears just above the <b>Plot list</b>. If you want to switch between different databases when the <b>Selected files</b> list is hidden, you can choose a new active database, also known as an active source, from the <b>Source</b> combo box. Selecting a new active source from the <b>Source</b> combo box is the same as highlighting a file in the <b>Selected files</b> list and clicking its <b>Activate</b> button. If you save your settings when the <b>Selected files</b> list is hidden, your future VisIt sessions will also not show the <b>Selected files</b> list. The <b>Main Window</b> is shown before and after hiding the <b>Selected files</b> list in Figure14-8.</p>
