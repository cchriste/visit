  <li>
<p align="left"><a name="a1">How do I download the newest version of VisIt?</a>
<i><font color="#0000FF">The newest version of VisIt can be downloaded by 
anonymous ftp from </font><a href="ftp://ftp.llnl.gov/pub/visit/visit1.3.2">
ftp://ftp.llnl.gov/pub/visit</a><font color="#0000FF">. Just type 
that URL into your web browser and a list of directories, containing the 
available versions of VisIt, will appear in your browser. 
Choose the version of VisIt that runs on your system and download it. You can 
then follow the installation instructions in the INSTALL_NOTES file.</font></i></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left"><a name="a2">What do I need in order to run VisIt?</a> <i>
<font color="#0000FF">VisIt runs on many platforms, including PCs running 
Windows and Linux. If you plan to run VisIt on a PC, we recommend at least a 
Pentium III with 128MB RAM and hardware accelerated graphics. VisIt also runs on 
many flavors of UNIX, including: Linux, IRIX, AIX, and Tru64. Our installations 
for IRIX and AIX include parallel versions of our compute engine so that VisIt 
can make use of several processors.</font></i></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left"><a name="a3">I have a Windows machine. Can I run VisIt?</a> <i>
<font color="#0000FF">Yes you can. As of version 0.9.10, you can download 
Windows 2000 version which is complete with an installation program. The 
executable program that you download extracts its contents to a temporary 
folder, which is usually <a href="file:///C:/VISITTEMP">C:\VISITTEMP</a>. From 
there, you can double click on the setup.exe installation program to install 
VisIt.</font></i></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left"><a name="a4">Where can I find sample data files to plot in VisIt?</a><font color="#0000FF"><i> 
VisIt reads a number of common file formats for storing scientific data. This 
includes but is not limited to Silo, Exodus, VTK, Plot3D, Ensight, and Alias 
Wavefront OBJ formats. When you download a VisIt distribution, you actually get 
sample Silo data files to use when trying VisIt out. If you installed a UNIX 
version and put it in /usr/local, then the data files would be located in /usr/local/visit/data. 
If you installed a Windows version, let's say version 1.1.4, and it installed in
<a href="file:///C:/Program">C:\Program</a> Files\LLNL\VisIt 1.1.4\, then the 
sample data files would be located in <a href="file:///C:/Program">C:\Program</a> 
Files\LLNL\VisIt 1.1.4\data\.You can also create your own data files by writing 
programs to write data in any of the formats that VisIt can read. You can also 
write new VisIt database reader plugins if you are interested in having VisIt 
read your own data file format. For more information on this, send e-mail to 
visit-help@llnl.gov.</i></font></p>

<p align="left"><a name="a5">How can I access files on a remote computer?</a><i><font color="#0000FF"> Open 
  the file selection window and type the name of the computer that you want to 
  access into the &quot;host&quot; text field. Doing this will launch part of VisIt on the 
  remote computer and allow you to access your files. Note that doing this 
  sometimes requires you to type in a&nbsp; password.</font></i></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left"><a name="a6">How do I create a plot?</a><font color="#0000FF"><i>In order to create a 
  plot, first you must open a file. This is done by selecting a file from the 
  file panel area of the main window and clicking the open button. Next, click 
  on the plots menu in the middle of the main window and choose a plot type and 
  a variable for that plot type. Once you've made your selection, release the 
  mouse button and the plot will be added to the plot list. Finally, click the 
  Draw button to get the plot to draw.</i></font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left"><a name="a7">What kinds of data can VisIt read?</a><font color="#0000FF"><i> 
VisIt can read and operate on scalar, vector, and material data that is stored 
in a variety of files formats. The file formats that VisIt currently understands 
are: Silo, Exodus, Ensight Gold, VTK, Plot3D, Alias Wavefront. VisIt also reads 
certain formats of ascii text files. If you want to have VisIt read your data, 
you can write a database reader plugin.</i></font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left"><a name="a8">I can't get VisIt to recognize that I have a time-varying 
database. The VCR controls never activate. Why? </a><i><font color="#0000FF">You know that those files are 
part of a time-varying database by the file naming convention that you used. 
VisIt can guess using the automatic file grouping feature, which is new in 
version 1.1.3, but it may guess incorrectly. You can either use automatic file 
grouping and provide a suitable file filter to remove any files that don't fit 
your naming convention, or you can create a .visit file. A .visit file is a text 
file that contains a list of file names (one per line) where each filename 
corresponds to one time state in your time-varying database. When you open a 
.visit file, VisIt knows that you are trying to open a set of related files and 
it works without any guessing.</font></i></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left"><a name="a9">How do I report a bug or request a new feature? </a>
<i><font color="#0000FF">You can let us 
know about bugs or ask for feature enhancements by sending e-mail to </font>
<a href="mailto:visit@llnl.gov">visit-help@llnl.gov</a><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left"><a name="a10">How do I know what changed from version to version? </a>
<font color="#0000FF"><i>We provide 
release notes with VisIt which give details on what we fixed or added for a 
release. You can read the release notes by selecting the Release notes option 
from the Main Window's Help menu.</i></font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left"><a name="a11">How do I use VisIt with Python? </a>
<font color="#0000FF"><i>There are two ways of using 
VisIt with Python. The first way is to use VisIt's cli program, which is 
actually a Python interpreter with VisIt extensions. To invoke the cli, type 
&quot;visit -cli&quot; at the command line prompt. The cli launches VisIt's viewer and 
then drops back into a regular Python command line session in which you can do 
any sort of Python processing. If you have a Python script that you want to run, 
you can also type: visit -cli -s filename, where filename is the name of the 
Python script that you want to execute. Another way to run VisIt in Python is to 
import the visit module by inserting &quot;import visit&quot; in your Python script. This 
method is not widely supported because we cannot be sure which version of Python 
is used on your system. There are also issues with VisIt being able to find its 
support libraries when running in it in this manner.</i></font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left"><a name="a12">Is VisIt parallel? </a><font color="#0000FF"><i>The short answer is yes. In fact, most VisIt 
components are serial applications, with the exception of the parallel version 
of the compute engine. The compute engine is the VisIt component that does all 
of the hard data processing work and it can be run on as many processors as are 
available. This comes in handy when you want to run VisIt on your desktop but 
connect to a remote machine where you want to run the compute engine in parallel 
to process a large database quickly. We designed VisIt to leverage remote 
compute power of large parallel computers with the interactivity of local 
desktop machines with fast graphics hardware.</i></font></p>
