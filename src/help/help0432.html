<h2><p>Setting the 2D view</h2></p>
<p>Setting the 2D view is conceptually simple. There are only two pieces of information that you need to supply. The first piece of information that you must enter is the viewport, which is an area of the visualization window in which you want the 2D plots to appear. Imagine that the lower left corner of the visualization window is the origin of a coordinate system and that the upper left and lower right corners both have values of 1. Every point in the visualization window can be characterized as a cartesian coordinate where both values in the coordinate are in the range [0,1]. The viewport is specified by entering four numbers in the form <i>x0 x1 y0 y1</i> where x0 is the leftmost X value, x1 is the rightmost X value, y0 is the lower Y value, and y1 is the upper Y value that will be used in the viewport. The window is an area in the space occupied by the 2D plots. You can start with a window that is the same size as the plot's spatial extents and then zoom in from there by making the window values smaller and smaller. The window values are also of the form <i>x0 x1 y0 y1</i>. To change the 2D view, type new values into the <b>Viewport</b> and <b>Window</b> text fields on the <b>View Window's 2D view tab</b> (Figure9-30).</p>
