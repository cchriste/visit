<h2><p>Setting how cells are removed</h2></p>
<p>The Box operator can either remove cells that are totally outside of the box or it can remove those cells outside of the box and cells that are only partially outside of the box. By default, the Box operator only removes cells that are completely outside of the box. To make the Box operator also remove cells that are partially outside of the box, you click the <b>All</b> radio button in the <b>Box operator attributes window</b> (shown in Figure4-10).</p>
