<h2><p>Resample operator</h2></p>
<p>The Resample operator extracts data from any input dataset in a uniform fashion, forming a new 2D or 3D rectilinear grid onto which the original dataset has been mapped. The Resample operator is useful in a variety of contexts such as downsampling a high resolution dataset (shown in Figure4-43), rendering Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) meshes, or mapping multiple datasets into a common grid for comparison purposes.</p>
