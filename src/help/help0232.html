<h2><p>Changing tube appearance</h2></p>
<p>The Tube operator provides a few knobs that control the appearance of the generated tubes. First of all, the tube width can be set by typing a new width into the <b>Width</b> text field in the <b>Tube operator attributes window </b>(Figure4-64). The number of polygons used to make up the circumference of the tube can be altered by typing a new number of sides into the <b>Fitness of tube</b> text field. Finally, the ends of tubes can be capped instead of remaining open by turning on the <b>Cap Tubes</b> check box.</p>
