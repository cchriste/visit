<h2><p>Transform operator</h2></p>
<p>The Transform operator manipulates a 2D or 3D database's coordinate field by applying rotation, scaling, and translation transformations. The operator's transformations are applied in the following order: rotation, scaling, translation. The Transform operator is applied to databases before they are plotted. You might use the Transform operator to rotate database geometry to a more convenient orientation or to scale database geometry to make better use of the visualization window. You can also use the Transform operator to make objects rotate and move around the visualization window during animations. This works well when only one part of the visualization should move while other parts and the view remain fixed. An example of the Transform operator is shown in Figure4-58.</p>
