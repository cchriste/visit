<h2><p>Creating complex subsets</h2></p>
<p>When visualizing a database, it is often useful to look at subsets created by subsetting more than one category. Suppose you have a database that has two subset categories: "Materials", and "domains" and that you want to turn off the "domain1" subset but you also want to turn off a material in the "domain4" subset. You can do this by clicking on the "domains" category and then unchecking the "domain1" check box in the second panel. Now, to turn off a material in the "domain4" subset, you click on the "domains" category in the left panel. Next, double-click on the "domain4" subset in the second panel. Select the "Materials" subset category in the second panel to make the third panel list the materials that you can remove from the "domain4" subset. Turning off a couple materials from the list in the third panel will only affect the "domain4" subset. An example of a complex subset is shown in Figure7-5 and the state of the <b>Subset window</b> is shown in Figure7-6.</p>
