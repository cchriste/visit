<h2><p>OnionPeel operator</h2></p>
<p>The OnionPeel operator creates a new unstructured mesh by taking a seed cell or node from a mesh and progressively adds more layers made up of the initial cell's neighboring cells. The resulting mesh is then plotted using any of VisIt's standard plots. The OnionPeel operator is often useful for debugging problems with scientific simulation codes, which often indicate error conditions for certain cells in the simulated model. Armed with the cell number that caused the simulation to develop problems, the user can visualize the simulation output in VisIt and examine the bad cell using the OnionPeel operator. The OnionPeel operator takes a cell index or a node index as a seed from which to start growing layers. Only the seed is shown initially but as you increase the number of layers, more of the cells around the seed are added to the visualization. An example of the OnionPeel operator is shown in Figure4-35.</p>
