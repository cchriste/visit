<h2><p>Elevate operator</h2></p>
<p>The Elevate operator uses a scalar field on a 2D mesh to elevate each node in the input mesh, resulting in a topologically 2D surface in 3D. The Elevate operator allows you to perform much of the same functionality as a Surface plot and it allows you to do additional things like elevate plots that do not accept scalar variables. The Elevate operator can also elevate plots whose input data was produced from higher dimensional data that has been sliced. Furthermore, the Elevate operator allows you to display multiple scalar fields in a single plot such as when a Pseudocolor plot of scalar variable A is elevated by scalar variable B (see Figure4-23).</p>
