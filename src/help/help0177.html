<h2><p>Using the Elevate operator</h2></p>
<p>The Elevate operator can be used to create plots that look much like a Surface plot if you simply apply the Elevate operator to a plot that accepts scalar values. The Elevate operator is more flexible than a Surface plot because whereas the Surface plot limits you to elevating by one variable and coloring by the same variable, the Elevate operator can be used with any plot and still acheive the Surface plot's elevated effect. You could use the Elevate operator to elevate a Pseudocolor plot of rainfall by elevation. You could also take Vector or FilledBoundary plots (among others) and elevate them by a scalar variable.</p>
<p>The most useful feature of the Elevate operator is its ability to elevate plots using an arbitrary scalar variable. By default, the Elevate operator uses the plotted variable in order to elevate the plot's mesh. This only works when the plotted variable is a scalar variable. When you apply the Elevate operator to plots that do not accept scalar variables, the Elevate operator will fail unless you choose a specific scalar variable using the <b>Elevate by Variable</b> variable menu in the <b>Elevate operator attributes window</b>.</p>
