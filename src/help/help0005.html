<h2><p>The Main Window</h2></p>
<p>VisIt's <b>Main Window</b>, shown in Figure1-3, contains three main areas: the <b>File panel</b>, <b>Plot Manager</b>, and <b>Notepad</b> area. The <b>File panel</b> is located at the top of the <b>Main Window</b> and it allows you to open databases and set the active time step for animations. The middle area of the <b>Main Window</b> is the <b>Plot Manager</b> area. The <b>Plot Manager</b> area contains controls that allow you to create and modify plots and operators. The bottom area of the <b>Main Window</b> is the <b>Notepad</b> area. The <b>Notepad</b> area is a blank area to which various VisIt windows can post. Each time a window posts to the <b>Notepad</b> area, a new tab is created in the <b>Notepad</b> and the posted window's contents are added to the new tab. Clicking on a tab in the notebook displays a posted window so that it can be used.</p>
