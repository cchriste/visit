<h2><p>ThreeSlice operator</h2></p>
<p>The ThreeSlice operator slices 3D databases using three axis-aligned slice planes and leaves the resulting planes in 3D where they can all be viewed at the same time. The ThreeSlice operator is meant primarily for quick visual exploration of 3D data where the internal features cannot be readily observed from the outside.</p>
