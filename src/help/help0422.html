<h2><p>Light type</h2></p>
<p>VisIt supports three types of lights. The first type is called an ambient light. An ambient light is a light that has no direction and contributes brightness to the entire visualization. When an ambient light is present, the lighting panel displays a small light bulb. The second type of light and the default light in VisIt is a camera light. A camera light stays fixed in space and always points the same direction regardless of how the objects in the visualization are positioned. Camera lights are represented in the lighting panel as small blue arrows. The third type of light in VisIt is the object light. An object light has a direction that is relative to the orientation of the object in the visualization. When the objects in the visualization are rotated, an object light keeps shining on the same area of the object. Object lights are represented in the lighting panel as small yellow cones. To change the light type for the active light, select a new light type from the <b>Light type</b> menu in the <b>Properties</b> panel.</p>
