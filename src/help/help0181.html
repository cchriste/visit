<h2><p>Setting a selection range</h2></p>
<p>The <b>Index select operator attributes window</b>, shown in Figure4-28, contains nine spin boxes that allow you to enter minimum and maximum ranges for i,j,k. To select all cells in the <b>X</b> dimension whose index is greater than 10, you would enter 10 into the spin box in the <b>I</b> row and <b>Min</b> column. Then you would enter max into the spin box in the <b>Max</b> column in the <b>I</b> row. Finally, you would enter a stride of 1 into the spin box in the <b>Incr</b> column in the <b>I</b> row. If you wanted to subselect cell ranges for the Y dimension, you could follow a similar procedure using the spin boxes in the <b>J</b> row and so forth.</p>
<p>To set a range, first select the maximum number of dimensions to which the Index select operator will apply. To set the dimension, click on the <b>1D</b>, <b>2D</b>, <b>3D</b> radio buttons. Note that if the chosen number of dimensions is larger than the number of dimensions in the database, the extra dimension ranges are ignored. It is generally best to select the same number of dimensions as the database. The three range text fields are listed in <i>i,j,k</i> order from top to bottom. To restrict the number of cells in the X-dimension, use spin boxes in the <b>I</b> row. To restrict the number of cells in the Y-dimension, use the spin boxes in the <b>J</b> row. To restrict the number of cells in the Z-dimension, use the spin boxes in the <b>K</b> row.</p>
