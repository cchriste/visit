<h2><p>Wireframe mode</h2></p>
<p>The Boundary plot and the FilledBoundary plot can be modified so that they only display outer edges of material boundaries. This option usually leaves lines that give only the rough shape of materials and where they join other materials as seen in Figure3-7. To make the Boundary or FilledBoundary plots display in wireframe mode, check the <b>Wireframe</b> check box near the bottom of the window.</p>
