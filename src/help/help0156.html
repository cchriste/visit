<h2><p>Box operator</h2></p>
<p>The Box operator, which is mostly intended for use with 3D datasets, removes areas of a plot that are either partially or completely outside of the volume defined by an axis-aligned box. The Box operator does not clip cells that straddle the box boundary, it just removes the cells from the visualization leaving jagged edges around the edges of the box where cells were removed. </p>
