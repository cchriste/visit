<h2><p>Posting a window</h2></p>
<p>Windows that have a <b>Post</b> button can be posted to the <b>Main Window's Notepad</b> area. Clicking on a window's <b>Post</b> button hides the window and adds its controls to a new tab in the <b>Notepad</b> area. Posting windows allows you to have several windows active at the same time without cluttering the screen. When a window is posted, its <b>Post</b> button turns to an <b>UnPost</b> button that, when clicked, removes the posted window from the <b>Notepad</b> area and displays the window in its own window. Figure1-4 shows an example of a window with a <b>Post</b> button and also shows the same window when it is posted to the <b>Notepad</b> area.</p>
