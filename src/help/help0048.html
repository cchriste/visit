<h2><p>Boundary and FilledBoundary Plots</h2></p>
<p>The Boundary plot and FilledBoundary plot are discussed together because of their similarity. Both plots concentrate on the boundaries between materials but each plot shows the boundary in a different way. The Boundary plot, shown in Figure3-5, displays the surface or lines that separate materials, while the FilledBoundary plot (see Figure3-6) shows the entire set of materials, each using a different color. Both plots perform material interface reconstruction on materials that have mixed cells, resulting in the material boundaries used in the plots.</p>
