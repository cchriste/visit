<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<!-- comment out for now

<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.9.0</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li>VisIt's Equivalence Class Function (DDF) ability now has a "Count"
    statistical operator.  This operator simply counts the number of data
    points that lie within a given bin.  This allows for easy generation of
    multidimensional histograms.</li>

    <li>VisIt can now be built with support for the SLIVR volume rendering
    library from SCI, University of Utah. SLIVR provides an advanced
    hardware-accelerated volume renderer and when it is available, the Volume
    plot attributes window provides a "SCI, University of Utah (SLIVR)"
    rendering method.</li>

    <li>A new "colorlookup" operator is now available for use in VisIt's
    expressions. This operator maps a scalar variable to a (color) vector
    variable by performing a lookup in one of VisIt's color tables. It can
    be used to "simulate" a Pseudocolor plot by means of a Truecolor plot,
    allowing users to perform several lookups and blend colors using
    expressions. CAVEAT: Unlike in the Pseudocolor plot, interpolation is
    performed AFTER a color table lookup instead of before. As a result,
    VisIt will interpolate colors after the lookup instead of values before
    lookup. </li>

    <li>Visit's Plot List Context Menu has the added option to "Disconnect Plot 
    from the TimeSlider". This functionality allows the user to plot multiple 
    times from a database of related files, by Right-Clicking on the plot(s) in
    the plot list.</li>

    <li>VisIt's <b>Save Movie</b> wizard now displays the <i>command to run
    later</i> in a window that allows you to cut and paste the command to
    run into a command prompt.</li>

    <li>VisIt's <b>Windows</b> menu now features an <b>Unlock
    everything</b> option under the <b>Lock</b> submenu.  The <b>Unlock
    everything</b> option turns off locking for time, tools, and view in
    all visualization windows.</li>

    <li>VisIt's <b>Preferences</b> window now has an option called <b>New
    plots inherit SIL restriction</b>, which allows you to turn off VisIt's
    default behavior of assigning a SIL restriction from a compatible plot
    to new plots when they are created.  If you turn off the <i>inherit</i>
    option, new plots will be created with all of their subsets
    selected.</li>

    <li>VisIt now looks for session files in the current directory by default. There is a preference in the <b>Preferences</b> window to make VisIt look for session files in your .visit directory by default.</li>

    <li>VisIt now automatically saves a crash recovery file every 5 minutes. If VisIt crashes, the next time you run VisIt, you will be prompted as to whether you want to restore the crash recovery session file to return to the last saved state. This crash recovery option can be disabled in the <b>Preferences</b> window.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.9.0</font></b></p>
<ul>

    <li>VisIt's Simulation database reader now supports materials whose
    material numbers do not begin at zero.  Ranges of material numbers
    where not all numbers are used are also supported now.</li>

    <li>VisIt displays an error message about not being able to read a file
    called "notset" when the GUI is opened from the CLI via the OpenGUI()
    function.</li>

    <li>VisIt's <b>Save Movie</b> wizard does not come to the front when it
    is activated until the GUI's <b>Main window</b> is clicked on MacOS
    X.</li>

    <li>VisIt's <b>File Open</b> dialog immediately closes when restoring a
    session file with different sources and the sources do not exist on the
    local computer.</li>

    <li>VisIt's Label plot now shows untransformed 3D vector data, even
    when a Slice operator that projects data to 2D is present in the
    pipeline.</li>

    <li>VisIt's viewer can crash when receiving commands from a simulation
    while already communicating with the simulation for other
    operations.</li>
