<p align="center"><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.1.5 Release Notes</font></b></p>
<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important 
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.1.5</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Databases can be reopened at the current timestep so variables that appear later in time are supported.</li>
  <li>VisIt has a new point tool that can be used to select a new origin for the new ThreeSlice operator, which performs three orthogonal slices on 3D databases and leaves the resulting slices in 3D.
  <li>Panning and zooming is vastly improved so that it no longer moves the camera.</li>
  <li>The Boundary plot now has a button for filled vs. unfilled.</li>
  <li>Pipeline caching is now off by default.</li>
  <li>Databases created by automatic file grouping are displayed expanded by default.</li>
  <li>VisIt now has a -config flag that lets you load a specific configuration file.</li>
  <li>Plots are recalculated only if the plot or operators attributes change.</li>
  <li>Saving settings to the config file now only saves the differences from the default settings.</li>
  <li>The Query window scrolls its output instead of clearing each time a query is performed.</li>
  <li>The vis window now has FullFrame mode, which is available vis the popup menu. FullFrame mode expands 2D plots so that they take up most of the vis window.</li>
  <li>The files in the selected files list now indicate file permissions through the use of color. Files are gray if they cannot be accessed.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.1.5</font></b></p>

  <li>Confusion between camera and view normal.</li>
  <li>CLI Pick function does not use secondary variables.</li>
  <li>Picking on a Subset plot (material 1 only) of globe.silo gives bad results. </li>
  <li>Antialiasing creates funny white outlines around tickmarks.</li>
  <li>Saved window sizes are incorrect when saving settings that use a multi-window layout.</li>
  <li>Picking on cone projected to 2D gives bad results.</li>
  <li>Subsets should be ordered in the Subset plot's legend.</li>
