<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.4.4 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.4.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Saving movies of the plots in your active visualization window is now possible within VisIt's GUI using the <b>Save movie</b> wizard. The <b>Save movie</b> wizard, located in the <b>Main</b> window's <b>File</b> menu, leads you through a set of screens that allow you to pick the resolutions and formats, output location, and generation method for your movie. Once you have completed the wizard's screens, VisIt starts making your movie. VisIt can use your current VisIt session to make your movie so you can use any processors that you have already allocated, or VisIt can start a new VisIt session, or tell you the command to use to generate your movie. If you choose to use your current VisIt session to make your movie, you will be able to watch your movie play through on screen. The movie's progress is also displayed in a <b>Movie progress</b> dialog so you can track VisIt's progress in generating your movie. The <b>Movie progress</b> dialog also provides a Cancel button if you decide to cancel your movie so you can resume working in your VisIt session.</li>
<li>VisIt has been enhanced so that multiple user interfaces can be used to drive the viewer. This makes it possible to use both the GUI and the CLI on the same visualizations. It is even possible to use multiple GUI's - even custom GUI's that you have written yourself in C++ or Java. The CLI, which is itself a type of VisIt user interface, provides functions <i>(OpenClient, OpenGUI)</i> that can be used to connect other VisIt clients to the viewer.</li>
<li>VisIt's GUI now provides a <b>Command</b> window that allows you to edit up to 8 Python scripts and execute them in VisIt's CLI at the click of a button. The <b>Command</b> window is available in the <b>Controls</b> menu. Saving your settings will cause the <b>Command</b> window's scripts to be saved so they are accessible in future VisIt sessions. Note that when VisIt executes scripts in this manner, the actual script execution is still performed by VisIt's CLI, which will display any script output in a seperate CLI window since the GUI and CLI are separate programs with little awareness of one another.</li>
<li>It is now possible to export variables, materials, and meshes from your active database to a file using the new <b>Export database</b> window. The <b>Export database</b> window is available in the <b>File</b> menu. The new window allows you to pick the output name, directory, format, of the exported database as wells as the list of variables, meshes, or materials that will be exported. The list of available formats for exporting databases is determined by those database reader plugins that can write out data in their native file format.</li>
<li>VisIt now provides an option to read all cycles and times from collections of single time-step databases <i>(like Silo)</i>. This option allows VisIt to display the cycles and times in the selected files list in the <b>Main</b> window and it also allows VisIt to create meaningful cycle or time-based database correlations for these types of databases. Database correlations are used to relate multiple time-varying databases on a common time scale, with a common time slider. Since VisIt can now create accurate cycle and time database correlations for collections of single time-step databases, it is now possible to more easily compare two or more simulations using a common time scale. Since it can be expensive to read in the extra time metadata for some types of files, this option is not enabled by default but VisIt will ask if you want to read in the extra data when it needs it. You can make VisIt always read in cycles and times by choosing <b>Try harder to get accurate cycles/times</b> in the <b>Preferences</b> window. If you want this option to take effect by default, be sure to save your settings after changing the setting in the <b>Preferences</b> window.</li>
<li>VisIt's CLI now has embedded documentation for most of its functions, making it easy to see the argument list and usage information for each function.</li>
<li>VisIt now supports image annotation objects, which allow you to place logos or other graphics in your visualizations. To add an image annotation, open the <b>Annotations</b> window, click on the <b>Objects</b> tab, and click on the <b>Image</b> button. Clicking on the <b>Image</b> button will tell VisIt to create an empty image annotation object. Once you select an image file using the <b>Image</b> annotation object's controls in the <b>Annotations</b> window and click the <b>Apply</b> button, VisIt will load your image and insert it into your visualization.</li>
<li>VisIt now supports 2D line annotation objects, which allow you to point to objects within your visualization. The lines have optional arrow endpoints that can be used to indicate direction.To add a 2D line annotation, open the <b>Annotations</b> window, click on the <b>Objects</b> tab, and click on the <b>2D line</b> button.</li>
<li>VisIt now supports multimeshes, multivars, multimaterials, and multispecies where some domains have no data. This means that in the multi-object definition, which usually points to the name of another file's variable for a particular domain, you can now provide "EMPTY" to indicate that the domain has no data. This enhancement prevents VisIt from failing to recognize when a mesh's domain list changes between time steps for certain database types.</li>
<li>The MacOS X version of VisIt can now save images offscreen and perform scalable rendering.</li>
<li>VisIt now has <i>Moment of Inertia</i> and <i>Centroid</i> queries.</li>
<li>VisIt can now read in a set of image slices as a 3D volume. Simply create a file ending in ".imgvol" that contains the names of the image files that make up the 3D volume and VisIt will use the images to construct a 3D volume. This feature is useful for viewing CT data, which is often stored as a set of 2D images.</li>
<li>VisIt's Image database reader plugin has been improved in a number of ways. For example, only processor 0 will read the image header now. Caching has been re-enabled and the reader can now generate ghost data.</li>
<li>Expressions stored in a Silo file in the <i>meshtv_defvars</i> variable now show up if their names contain slashes.</li>
<li>VisIt can now make movies using the window size stored in a session file if you omit the <i>-geometry</i> argument to the <i>visit -movie</i> script. There is also a new <i>Make movie</i> option that does this when you right-click on a session file on the Windows platform.</li>
<li>VisIt's <i>volume</i> calculation is now tuned for rectilinear meshes.  This quantity is used in several data analysis operations, for example calculating a weighted sum</li>
<li>The Transform operator now changes the axis labels when switching from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical or spherical coordinates.</li>
<li>The KullLite database reader plugin can now adaptively switch its axis labels from X-Y to R-Z.</li>
<li>VisIt's metadata server no longer automatically consolidates virtual databases of Flash files into larger virtual databases since that behavior caused problems for some users. If you want to make VisIt do this again, set the <i>VISIT_CONSOLIDATE_VIRTUAL_DATABASES</i> environment variable to <i>on</i>.</li>
<li>Many optimizations were put in place to support large AMR problems with large numbers of patches.</li>
<li>VisIt's ghost zone communication was heavily optimized.</li>
<li>The following new math expressions were added: mod, round, ceil, and floor</li>
<li>VisIt can now use expressions to calculate what your mesh's coordinates are in cylindrical coordinates.  In addition, new expressions were added to access components of these coordinates -- cylindrical_radius and cylindrical_theta, as well as polar_radius, polar_theta, and polar_phi.</li>
<li>VisIt's window layout logic has been changed so VisIt will always create the largest square windows in the available space.</li>
<li>VisIt's rarely used 4x4 window layout has been replaced by a 2x3 window layout.</li>
<li>VisIt now supports the creation of red/green stereo images.</li>
<li>When VisIt issues a warning about bad input data, it now tells you which variables are incorrectly sized.</li>
<li>The VisIt installation program for the Windows platform now migrates configuration files from earlier versions of VisIt (if any are found) to the new version of VisIt.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.4.4</font></b></p>

<li>VisIt refuses to plot a FilledBoundary plot to which the Displace operator has been applied.</li>
<li>Some VisIt filters do not make use of spatial and data extents when they should due to a coding issue a filter that is a facade for other filters.</li>
<li>VisIt's <i>visitconvert</i> program issues a lot of warnings when converting image files to another format.</li>
<li>Recentering a color image from zonal to nodal causes the Truecolor plot to display nothing.</li>
<li>The spatial extents query now has the correct return type in the command-line interface</li>
<li>Volume rendering now works correctly on rectilinear grids that have been reflected using the Reflect operator.</li>
<li>Picking on plots using the <i>mirvf</i> expression yields incorrect results on second and subsequent picks.</li>
