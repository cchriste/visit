<h2><p>Setting axis label properties</h2></p>
<p>The axis labels are the labels that appear along the 2D plot viewport. This includes the title of the axis as well as the numeric labels that indicate the plot's spatial dimensions. By default, the axis labels are enabled and set to appear for both the X and Y axes. You can turn the labels off for one or more axes unchecking the <b>Show labels</b> check boxes on the <b>Annotation Window's 2D Options tab</b>. You can change the size of the axis labels and titles by entering new font sizes, specified as a percentage of vis window height, into the <b>Label font height</b> and <b>Title font height</b> text fields. Note that you can set these label properties for the X and Y dimensions independently.</p>
