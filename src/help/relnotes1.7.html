<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.7 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Announcements</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The naming of VisIt releases has changed. The previous versioning scheme allowed for features to be added into patch releases (the third digit in the version number). This gave rise to release numbers such as: <i>1.5, 1.5.1, ..., 1.5.5, 1.6</i>. The new versioning paradigm will increment the second number in the version number with each release of VisIt. The third digit in the version number, when present, will represent a bug fix made to an existing released version of the code. Patch releases of VisIt will be compatible with each other in distributed mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.7</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now create a visual spreadsheet through picking. Pick-points are highlighted and labeled in the spreadsheet.</li>
<li>It is possible to choose a font that is used for values in the spreadsheet table. The column width is chosen automatically to avoid truncating displayed values.</li>
<li>In spreadsheet plots it is now possible to turn on/off display of tracer plane and patch  boundaries independently.</li>
<li>The <i>Revolved Surface Area</i> and <i>Revolved Volume</i> queries are now time-enabled</li>
<li>The Elevate operator has a new option to elevate by a "zero" height, allowing quick conversion of plots from 2D to 3D.</li>
<li>Added a new database reader for the University of Tennessee's VLI multivariate data server.</li>
<li>VisIt has a new RAW triangle database reader and writer. The RAW format is an ASCII format consisting of triangle definitions where there is one triangle per line and a triangle is defined by 9 space delimited floating point numbers. The RAW format allows mesh geometry to be shared with CAD programs and rendering programs such as Blender and POVRay.</li>
<li>VisIt has a new NETCDF-based reader for CCSM data, which is climate data. The reader exposes 2D and 3D time-varying mesh data and also provides an alternate representation of the data mapped onto a globe.</li>
<li>Added a new HDF5-based reader for the fusion code, M3D. The reader exposes the full mesh, and each plane in both 2D and 3D. </li>
<li>A new '-diffsum' option was added to VisIt to quickly summarize the differences in two databases and output results in textual form.</li>
<li>Added Claw database plugin that reads Claw format, ascii amr mesh files.</li>
<li>Added ZipWrapper database plugin so VisIt can directly open gzip and bzip compressed databases without having to uncompress
the files before opening them in VisIt.</li>
<li>Created a reader for the SAS file format, used at Argonne National Lab.</li>
<li>Improved performance of the DiffSummary() when running VisIt in database differencing mode.</li>
<li>VisIt now has an option to turn on/off automatic creation of <i>Mesh Quality</i> and <i>Time Derivative</i> expressions when the database is read.  This setting is saved in a users's custom settings when <i>Save Settings</i> is used. The default behavior is for this feature to be ON.  The controls are located in the Options->Preferences window.  If this option is changed while a database is open, reopening the database will add/remove the expression variables (corresponding to the on/off condition).</li>
<li>Added support for depth cueing with an arbitrary angle when Scalable Rendering mode is enabled.</li>
<li>If you have a private plugin from an old version of VisIt, VisIt will now successfully ignore that plugin and load the plugin from the new version of VisIt.</li>
<li>Separated the Rendering attributes window into tabs to better support lower desktop resolutions.</li>
<li>Added support for szlib compression library (used in HDF5, HDF4, Silo, and H5Part). New <i>configure</i> option <i>--with-szip=INC-DIR,LIB-DIR</i>, and config-site file options <i>DEFAULT_SZIP_INCLUDE=</i>, and <i>DEFAULT_SZIP_LIB=</i> are recognized.</li>
<li>The <i>build_visit</i> GUI have been enhanced to allow interactive selection of most of the command line options available.</li>
<li>The behavior for projecting a slice has been improved.  If a point is explicitly defined to establish the plane, that point will be projected to (0,0).</li>
<li>VisIt now uses the ghost data from Chombo files, rather reproducing the information.</li>
<li>The Python wrappings for the visit_writer module are now installed with VisIt.</li>
<li>The simulation steering window was updated with a new strip chart tab window. This is a postable/unpostable window that allows the simulation writer to monitor up to five simulation variables at a time in separate strip chart windows. The ability to reset
a strip chart was added so
that a user could restart without spurious startup values interfering with the interpretation of the data. The tab labels can be set via the running simulation to identify the variable being plotted. The current value of the data is now displayed in addition to the min and max data. </li>
<li>A custom renderer was implemented for the ParallelAxis plot that, among other things, obviates the need to recalculate the plot when only an Extents slider or axis selector slider is moved.</li>
<li>The Threshold operator was improved to be more forgiving when incomplete attributes are input to it in the CLI.</li>
<li>The Protein Data Bank file format reader now supports compounds (via COMPND records).</li>
<li>The mouse wheel can now be used to zoom in and out.</li>
<li>The Chombo database plugin now recognizes material fraction (embedded boundary) variables and translates them into material information for VisIt.</li>
<li>The Chombo database plugin can now read expressions stored in the Chombo file and add them to VisIt's expression list.</li>
<li>Material interfaces (embedded boundaries) can now be accessed as operator as well as plot, e.g., to restrict displaying of normal vectors to material boundaries.</li>
<li>The plane tool can now control the Clip operator.</li>
<li>The H5Part plugin now supports field data as well as particle data.</li>
<li>Added an optimization to the parallel connected components algorithm that utilizes ghost zone neighbors to reduce memory and communication overhead.
This optimization may not be appropriate for all problems and can be disabled when defining a connected components expression.</li>
<li>Extended the connected components to work on structured meshes.</li>
<li>VisIt's gradient expression was updated to provide an algorithm selection mechanism.<br>
The available gradient algorithms are: sample (default), logical, nzqh (a new gradient method described below).<br>
To define a expression use the following syntax:<br>
<ul>
<li> gradient(var), gradient(var,0) or gradient(var,"sample")</li>
<li> gradient(var,1) or gradient(var,"logical") </li>
<li> gradient(var,2) or gradient(var,"nzqh") </li>
</ul>
Macro expressions that utilize the gradient (divergance, curl, and laplacian) also provide this selection mechanism.<br>
Old logical gradient expression names (ij_gradient, ijk_gradient) were retained for backward compatibility. </li>
<li>Added a much more accurate logical gradient for structured grids composed of quad or hex cells. This gradient is called "nzqh".</li>
<li>Added support for the Silo Multi Mesh Adjacency Object to the Silo database plugin creating an efficient path for VisIt to obtain connectivity info.<br>
Please see the latest Silo manual for information about the Multi Mesh Adjacency Object.</li>
<li>
Added additional database annotation path expansion options, bringing the available options to:
<ul>
<li>File: File name only</li>
<li>Directory: Full directory path</li>
<li>Full: Full path</li>
<li>Smart: Min unique path across plots </li>
<li>Smart Directory: Min unique directory across plots </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a <i>General</i> tab to the Annotation Attributes window to better support lower desktop resolutions.</li>
<li>Added a VTK debug mode that helps track memory management of VTK objects in VisIt's pipelines. </li>
<li>Added user settable floating point format string for Picks, Queries, and the Label Plot.</li>
<li>Added an option to save windows at a resolution proportional to the current screen, and made that the default.</li>
<li>Added movie making options for framerate and start/end time.</li>
<li>Added a reader for the ddcMD cgrid file format. To open a ddcMD "file", the user must create a zero length file with the same name as the directory containing the cgrid files with one of the supported extensions. The supported extensions include ".ddcmd", ".ddcMD", and ".DDCMD". The reader will automatically partition the mesh over all the processors when run in parallel.</li>
</ul>
