<h2><p>Selecting a help page</h2></p>
<p>The <b>Help Window</b> has three tabs, shown in Figure15-3, that allow a help page to be located in different ways. The first tab is the <b>Contents</b> tab and it lists all of the online help pages and allows them to be grouped into related topics. The <b>Index</b> tab lists all of the online help pages in an alphabetized list that can be searched for a particular help topic. The <b>Bookmarks</b> tab shows all bookmarked help pages which can be recalled by clicking on a bookmark.</p>
