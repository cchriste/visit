<h2><p>Locking Windows</h2></p>
<p>When you visualize databases using multiple visualization windows, it is often convenient to keep the time state and view in sync between windows so you can concentrate on comparing plots instead of dealing with the intricacies of setting the view or time state for each visualization window. VisIt's visualization windows can be locked with respect to time, view, or interactive tools. You can use the <b>Lock</b> toolbar, shown in Figure12-20, to lock visualization windows together with respect to view and time.</p>
