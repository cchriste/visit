<h2><p>Changing view perspective</h2></p>
<p>When the vis window contains 3D plots, the perspective setting can be used to enhance how 3D the plot looks. In a perspective projection, graphics grow smaller as they recede into the distance which makes them look more realistic. To change the perspective setting, click on the <b>Perspective</b> option in the <b>Popup menu's</b> <b>View</b> menu (see Figure6-12). When the vis window uses a perspective projection, the Popup menu's Perspective option will have a selection rectangle around its icon. You can also turn perspective on or off by clicking on the <b>Perspective icon</b> in the <b>Toolbar</b>. The difference in appearance having perspective and not having it is shown in Figure6-13.</p>
