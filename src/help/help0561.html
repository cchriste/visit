<h2><p>Reading accurate cycles and times from databases</h2></p>
<p>Many of the file formats that VisIt reads contain a single time state, making accurate cycles and times unavailable in VisIt's metadata for all but the open time state. Files formats afflicted with this problem (like Silo) will display zero or "?" times next to the files in the <b>Selected files</b> list when you have told VisIt to display times next to the file names. To get accurate times and cycles for these types of files, VisIt would have to open each file in the database, which can be a costly operation. VisIt does not go to this extra effort unless you turn on the <b>Try harder to get accurate cycles/times</b> option. This option allows VisIt to display the cycles and times in the <b>Selected files </b>list and it also allows VisIt to create meaningful cycle or time-based database correlations for groups of single time state databases. Note that if you enable the <b>Try harder to get accurate cycles/times</b> option after you've opened a database, the cycles and times will not be retrieved for the open database unless you reopen it.</p>
