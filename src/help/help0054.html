<h2><p>Drawing only clean zones</h2></p>
<p>The FilledBoundary plot, since it deals almost exclusively with plotting materials, has an option to only draw clean zones, which are zones that contain a single material. When only clean zones are drawn, all clean cells are drawn normally but all zones that contained more than one material are drawn with a color that can be set to match the vis window's background color (see Figure3-8). Drawing clean zones is primarily used to examine how materials mix in 2D databases. To make VisIt draw only the clean zones, click the <b>Clean zones only</b> check box. After that, you can set the mixed color by clicking on the <b>Mixed color</b> color button and selecting a new color from the popup color palette.</p>
