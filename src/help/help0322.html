<h2><p>Smoother material boundary interfaces</h2></p>
<p>VisIt's material interface reconstruction algorithm sometimes produces small, pointy outcroppings on reconstructed material boundaries next to where clean cells are located. Since these are often distracting features when looking at a visualization, VisIt provides an interface smoothing option that allows materials to bleed a little bit into clean cells to improve how they look when their material boundary is reconstructed. Figure7-11 shows a plot that has not been smoothed next to a plot that has been smoothed. To enable interface smoothing, check the <b>Enable interface smoothing</b> check box. Note that changing this setting will not affect plots that have already been generated. If you want to make your current plots regenerate with smoother interfaces, you must also clear them out of the visualization window by choosing the <b>Plots</b> option from the <b>Clear</b> submenu located in the <b>Main Window's Windows </b>menu.</p>
