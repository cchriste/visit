<h2><p>Expanding plots</h2></p>
<p>Plot list entries are normally collapsed by default so the operators applied to plots are shown in the <b>Plot list</b> as a series of nested operators, which finally take a variable as an argument. The <b>Plot list</b> allows plot list entries to be expanded on a per-plot basis so you can get to each individual operator that is applied to a plot. To expand a plot list entry, click on its expand button, shown in Figure4-4. When a plot list entry is expanded, the plot's database, all operators, and finally the plot get their own line in the plot list entry. This is significant because it allows operators to have additional controls to let you reposition them in the pipeline or remove them from the middle of the pipeline without having to first remove other operators.</p>
