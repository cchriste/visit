<h2><p>The Printer Window</h2></p>
<p>Open the <b>Printer window</b> by selecting <b>Set Print options</b> from the <b>Main Window's File menu</b>. The <b>Printer Window's</b> appearance is influenced by the platform on which you are running VisIt so you may find that it looks somewhat different when you use the Windows, UNIX<sup>TM</sup>, or MacOS X versions of VisIt. The Linux version of the <b>Printer Window</b> is shown in Figure5-12.</p>
<p>The <b>Printer Window</b> contains a number of options to set the destination printer, number of pages to print, and paper orientation. After changing the settings, click the <b>Apply</b> button to apply the settings or click <b>Cancel</b> to revert to the previous settings. To print an image, select the <b>Print window</b> option from the <b>Main Window's File menu</b>.</p>
<p>Note that the <b>Print</b> <b>window</b> (see Figure5-13) looks and behaves a little differently on MacOS X. When it comes up, clicking the <b>Print</b> button causes immediate printing unlike printing on other platforms. This was done deliberately to be more consistent with other MacOS X applications.</p>
