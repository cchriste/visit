<h2><p>Label Plot</h2></p>
<p>The Label plot, shown in Figure3-14, can display mesh information, scalar fields, vector fields, tensor fields, array variables, subset names, and material names. The Label plot is often used as a debugging device for simulation codes since it allows the user to see labels containing the exact values at the computational mesh's nodes or cell centers. Since the Label plot's job is to display labels representing the computational mesh or the fields defined on that mesh, it does not convey much information about the actual mesh geometry. Since having a Label plot by itself does not usually give enough information to understand the plotted dataset, the Label plot is almost always used with other plots.</p>
