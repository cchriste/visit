<h2><p>Making lines look smoother</h2></p>
<p>Computer monitors contain an array of millions of tiny rectangular pixels that light up to form patterns which your eyes perceive as images. Lines tend to look blocky on computer monitors because they are drawn using a relatively small set of pixels. Lines can be made to look better by blending the edges of the line with the color of the background image. This is a form of antialiasing that VisIt can use to make plots which use lines, such as the Mesh plot, look better (see Figure9-26). If you want to enable antialiasing, which is off by default, you check the <b>Antialiasing</b> check box in the <b>Rendering Options Window</b>. When antialiasing is enabled, all lines drawn in a visualization window are blended with the background image so that they look smoother.</p>
