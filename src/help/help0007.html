<h2><p>Using the main menu</h2></p>
<p>VisIt's <b>Main Menu</b> contains five menu options that allow you to access many of VisIt's most useful features. Each menu option displays a submenu when you click it. The options in the submenus perform an action such as saving an image. Menu options that contain a name followed by ellipsis open another VisIt window. Some menu options have keyboard shortcuts that activate windows. The <b>File</b> menu contains options that open VisIt windows that allow you to open files, manage compute engines and host profiles, save images, and print images. The <b>Controls</b> menu contains options that open VisIt windows that, for the most part, set the look and feel of VisIt's visualization windows. The colors, annotations, lighting, and view can be set through some of the options available in the <b>Controls</b> menu. The <b>Options</b> menu contains options that allow you to set the appearance of the GUI, manage VisIt plugins, and save VisIt's settings to a configuration file. The <b>Windows</b> menu contains controls that manage visualization windows. The <b>Help</b> menu provides options for viewing online help, VisIt's copyright agreement, and release notes which describe the major enhancements and fixes in each new version of VisIt. The options for each menu are shown in Figure1-5 and will be described in detail later in this manual.</p>
<p>The <b>Main Menu</b> and the <b>Plot and operator</b> menu are merged in the MacOS X version of VisIt because MacOS X applications always have all menus in the system menu along the top of the display. </p>
