<h2><p>Isovolume operator</h2></p>
<p>The Isovolume operator creates a new unstructured mesh using only cells and parts of cells from the original mesh that are within the specified data range for a variable. The resulting mesh can be used in other VisIt plots. You might use this operator when searching for cells that have certain values. The Isovolume operator can either use the plotted variable or a variable other than the plotted variable. For instance, you might want to see a Pseudocolor plot of pressure while using the Isovolume operator to remove all cells and parts of cells below a certain density. An example of a plot to which an Isovolume operator has been applied is shown in Figure4-33.</p>
