#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 12 14:32:19 PDT 2002
#    Changed moc location.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Aug 21 11:07:27 PDT 2002
#    I added list????.html files to the distributed files.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Aug 4 15:16:39 PST 2004
#    I added the visit include directory so we can get visitstream.h.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Feb 17 16:46:15 PST 2005
#    I changed the DISTRIB tag to IF_AVAILABLE_DISTRIB tag so we get 
#    the specified files if they are available but no warnings if they are
#    not available.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Jun 29 10:00:24 PDT 2007
#    Removed the setting of the IF_AVAILABLE_DISTRIB variable.
