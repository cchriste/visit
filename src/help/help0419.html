<h2><p>Switching between edit mode and preview mode</h2></p>
<p>Clicking the radio buttons for <b>Edit</b> or <b>Preview</b> switches the <b>Lighting Window</b> into the desired mode. When the <b>Lighting Window</b> is in edit mode, one light source at a time is shown in the lighting panel and the lights properties can be set by moving the light interactively or by settings its properties by using the controls in the <b>Properties</b> panel. When the <b>Lighting Window</b> is in preview mode, all lights are shown in the lighting panel and none of them can be modified.</p>
