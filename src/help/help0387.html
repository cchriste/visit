<h2><p>3D Annotations</h2></p>
<p>VisIt has a number of controls, located on the <b>3D Options tab</b>, in the <b>Annotation Window</b> for controlling annotations that are used when the visualization window contains 3D plots. Like the 2D controls, these controls focus mainly on the axes that are drawn around plots. Figure9-5 shows an example 3D plot with the 3D annotations labeled and Figure9-6 shows the <b>Annotation Window's 3D Options</b> tab.</p>
