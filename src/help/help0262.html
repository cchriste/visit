<h2><p>Clearing plots from vis windows</h2></p>
<p>The <b>Main Window's Windows menu</b> provides a <b>Clear all</b> option that you can use to clear the plots from all vis windows. Selecting this option does not delete the plots from a vis window's plot list but it does clear the plots so they have to be regenerated by VisIt's compute engine. You can also clear the plots for just the active window by selecting the <b>Plots</b> option from the <b>Clear</b> submenu in the <b>Main Window's Windows</b> menu (see Figure6-3). You might find clearing plots useful when you want to make several changes to plot attributes because, unlike plots that are already generated, setting attributes of cleared plots does not force them to regenerate when you change their attributes.</p>
<p>In addition to clearing plots, you can also clear pick points and reference lines from a vis window. A pick point is a marker that VisIt adds to a vis window when you click on a plot in pick mode. The marker indicates the location of the pick point. A reference line is a line that you draw in a vis window when it is in lineout mode. You can clear a vis window's pick points or reference lines, by selecting the <b>Pick points</b> or <b>Reference lines</b> options from the <b>Clear</b> submenu in the <b>Main Window's Windows</b> menu.</p>
