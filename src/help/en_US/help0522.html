<h2>Setting the parallel launch method</h2>
<p>
The parallel launch method option allows you to specify which launch program should be used to execute the parallel compute engine. This setting depends on the computer where you plan to run the compute engine and how the computer is configured. Some computers have multiple launch programs depending on which part of the parallel machine you want to use. The table below lists some common Operating System/Launch program pairs.

<p>
In addition to choosing a launch program, you can also elect to give it additional command line options to influence how it launches your compute engine. To give additional command line options to the launch program, click the <b>Additional launcher arguments</b> check box and type command line options into the text field to the right of that check box.
