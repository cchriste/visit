<h2>Turning plot legends off globally</h2>
<p>
Plot legends are special annotations that are added by plots. An example of a plot legend is the color bars and title that the Pseudocolor plot adds to the visualization window. Normally, plot legends are turned on or off by a check box in a plot attribute window but VisIt also provides a check box in the <b>Annotation Window</b> that can turn off the plot legends for all plots in the visualization window. You can use the <b>Legend </b>check box at the top of the <b>Annotation Window</b> to turn plot legends off if they are present.
