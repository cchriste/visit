<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Simulation data must often be compared to experimental data so VisIt provides a number of features that allow quantitative information to be extracted from simulation databases. This chapter explains how to visualize derived variables created with expressions and query information about a database. This chapter also explains VisIt's Pick and Lineout capabilities which allow quantitative data to be obtained from the visualization.
