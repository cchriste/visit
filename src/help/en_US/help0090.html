<h2>Limits</h2>
<p>
Setting limits for the plot imposes artificial minima and maxima on the plotted variable. This effectively restricts the range of data used to color the Pseudocolor plot. You might set limits when you are interested in only a small range of the data or when data limits need to be maintained for multiple time steps, as when playing an animation. In fact, we recommend setting the limits when producing an animation so the colors will correspond to the same values instead of varying over time with the range of the plotted variable. Setting limits often highlights a certain range in the data by assigning more colors to that data range.

<p>
To set the limits for the Pseudocolor plot, you must first select the limit mode. The limit mode determines whether the original data extents (data extents before any portions of the plot are removed), are used or the current plot data extents (data extents after any portions of the plot are removed), are used. To select the limit mode, choose either <b>Use Original Data</b> or <b>Use </b><b>Current Plot</b> from the <b>Limits</b> menu.
</p>
<p>
The limits for the Pseudocolor plot consist of a minimum value and a maximum value. You may set these limits, and turn them on and off, independently of one another. That is, the use of one limit does not require the use of the other. To set a limit, check the <b>Min</b> or <b>Max</b> check box next to the <b>Min</b> or <b>Max</b> text field and type a new limit value into the <b>Min</b> or <b>Max</b> text field.
