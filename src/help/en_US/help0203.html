<h2>Reflecting plots</h2>
<p>
Once the Reflect operator has been applied to plots, you must usually specify the direction in which the plots should be reflected. To set the plot direction, click on the check boxes below the <b>Original data is in octant menu</b>. The possible reflections are shown by the cube and sphere glyphs. When a reflection is set to be on, the glyph in the octant or quadrant will be green or magenta. When a reflection is not on, its glyph is smaller and silver. To turn a reflection on or off, just click on its glyph. If the window is in its 3D input mode and you need to access octants in the back that are obscured by other octants, clicking on the cyan arrow will rotate the glyphs to the octants in the back will be more accessible.
