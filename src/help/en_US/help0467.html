<h2>Saving the Command Window's Python scripts</h2>
<p>
The <b>Command Window</b> is meant to be a sandbox for experimenting with small Python scripts that help you visualize your data. You will often hit upon small scripts that can be used over and over. The scripts in each of the eight tabs in the <b>Command Window</b> can be saved for future VisIt sessions if you save your settings. Once you save your settings, any Python scripts that are present in the <b>Command Window</b> are preserved for future use.
