<h2><p>Opening a file on a remote computer</h2></p>
<p>Opening a file on a remote computer works like opening a file on your local computer because the files from the remote computer have been placed into the <b>File panel</b>. The only difference is that when the <b>File panel </b>contains files from multiple computers, it displays the list of files from each computer under a small computer icon that represents the computer where the files are located. An example of this is shown in Figure2-7.</p>
