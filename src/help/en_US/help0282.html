<h2>Recentering the view</h2>
<p>
Sometimes adding a plot to a vis window that already contains plots can result in a lop-sided visualization. This happens when the spatial extents of the plots do not match. The <b>Popup menu</b> has a <b>Recenter view</b> option (see figure) to calculate a new center of rotation for the plots so they are drawn in the center of the window. You can also recenter the view by clicking on the <b>Recenter view icon</b> in the <b>Toolbar</b>. To make sure that the view updates appropriately when new plots are added to the vis window, you may also want to check the <b>Auto center view</b> check box that is available in the <b>View Window</b>.
