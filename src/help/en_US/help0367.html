<h2>Curve plot</h2>
<p>
Curve plots are created by drawing reference lines. The visualization window must be in lineout mode before references lines can be created. You can create a reference line by positioning the mouse over the first point of interest, clicking the left mouse button and then moving the mouse, while pressing the left mouse button, and releasing the mouse over the second endpoint. Releasing the mouse button creates a reference line along the path that was drawn with the mouse. When you draw a reference line, you cause a Curve plot of the data along the reference line to appear in another visualization window. If another visualization window is not available, VisIt opens a new one before creating the Curve plot. The Curve plot in the second window can be modified by setting the active window to the visualization window that contains the Curve plots.
