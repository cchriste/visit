<h2>Fullframe mode</h2>
<p>
Some databases yield plots that are so long and skinny that they leave most of the vis window blank when VisIt displays them. A common example is equation of state data, which often has at least 1 exponential dimension. VisIt provides Fullframe mode to stretch long, skinny plots so they fill more of the vis window so it is easier to see them. It is worth noting that Fullframe mode does not preserve a 1:1 aspect ratio for the displayed plots because they are stretched in each dimension so they fit better in the vis window. To activate Fullframe mode, click on the <b>Auto</b> or <b>On</b> buttons in the <b>View Window</b>. When Fullframe mode is set to <b>Auto</b>, VisIt determines the aspect ratio of the X and Y dimensions for the plots being visualized and automatically scales the plots to fit the window when extents for one of the dimensions are much larger than the extents of the other dimension.
