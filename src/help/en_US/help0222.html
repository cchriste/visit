<h2>Threshold operator</h2>
<p>
The Threshold operator extracts cells from 2D and 3D databases where the plotted variable falls into a specified range. The resulting database can be used in other VisIt plots. You might use this operator when searching for cells with certain values. One such example is searching for the cell with the minimum or maximum value for the plotted variable. The Threshold operator removes all cells that do not have values in the specified range, making it easy to spot cells with the desired values. The Threshold operator can also use variables other than the plotted variable, for instance, you might want to see a Pseudocolor plot of pressure while using the Threshold operator to remove all cells below a certain density. By specifying a different threshold variable, it is possible to visualize different quantities over the subset of cells specified by the threshold variable and range. An example of the Threshold operator is shown in figure.
