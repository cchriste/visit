<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 2.0.1 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 2.0.1 is primarily a bug fix release to release 2.0. It fixes additional bugs in release 2.0. Look <a href="relnotes2.0.0.html">here</a> to see a complete list of changes in release 2.0.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.0.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>A bug was fixed in the Spreadsheet plot, restoring its ability to select the domain whose data is shown.</li>
<li>The resample operator's distributed resampling mode now works correctly in parallel (as one would expect).</li>
<li>A bug was fixed where number of passive scalars in legacy Nek files was being misinterpreted.</li>
<li>If a non-compliant Nek file is encountered, VisIt is better at reporting to the user why the file is non-compliant.</li>
<li>It no longer crashes the GUI when you delete the last variable in the Threshold operator's attributes window.</li>
<li>Large, time-varying PlainText files can now be processed with a constant memory footprint.</li>
<li>Symbols needed by "import visit" in a Python interpreter have been exposed so they are not hidden by default when building with visibility=hidden.</li>
<li>The visit.so and visitmodule.so Python modules now are installed with $ORIGIN rpath so their dependent shared libraries can be found when Python imports the modules.</li>
<li>Certain AMR meshes with only one refinement level were crashing VisIt.  This has been fixed.</li>
<li>A couple of bugs were corrected with the reading of unstructured meshes with polyhedral elements in the Silo database reader.</li>
<li>The visit.so Python module used by "import visit" now contains additional initialization to prevent crashes when executing user-defined callback functions.</li>
<li>A parallel bug with the Elliptical Compactness query was fixed. The bug resulted in incorrect ellipse axis fitting for multi-domain problems.</li>
<li>A bug preventing Silo's 'MetaDataIsTimeVarying' flag from working was fixed.</li>
<li>A bug with parsing bool arguments for Python Filter contract wrappers was resolved.</li>
<li>The PDB reader was enhanced so it provides laserid and rayid variables for laser rays.</li>
<li>By request of an LLNL code team, PDB reader was changed so it no longer exchanges the X/Z axes.</li>
<li>A bug in Restore Session with Sources was fixed so that gui will no longer crash when second (or greater) source is selected.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.0.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Boxlib reader now represents the AMR nesting structure in a more efficient manner.  Adding plots, changing time slices, etc, should be noticably faster for simulations with large numbers of patch.</li>
<li>Windows installer was improved slightly to play better with Windows 7 / Vista.</li>
<li>Default save location for session files on windows is no longer current directory.</li>
<li>Session files on windows are now saved with '.session' extension for compatibility with *nix platforms.  Old sessions with '.vses' extension can still be loaded.</li>
</ul>
