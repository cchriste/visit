<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 2.0.1 is primarily a bug fix release to release 2.0. It fixes additional bugs in release 2.0. Look <a href="relnotes2.0.0.html">here</a> to see a complete list of changes in release 2.0.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.0.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The resample operator's distributed resampling mode now works correctly in parallel (as one would expect).</li>
<li>A bug was fixed where number of passive scalars in legacy Nek files was being misinterpreted.</li>
<li>If a non-compliant Nek file is encountered, VisIt is better at reporting to the user why the file is non-compliant.</li>
<li>It no longer crashes the GUI when you delete the last variable in the Threshold operator's attributes window.</li>
<li>Large, time-varying PlainText files can now be processed with a constant memory footprint.</li>
<li>Symbols needed by "import visit" in a Python interpreter have been exposed so they are not hidden by default when building with visibility=hidden.</li>
<li>The visit.so and visitmodule.so Python modules now are installed with $ORIGIN rpath so their dependent shared libraries can be found when Python imports the modules.</li>
<li>A couple of bugs were corrected with the reading of unstructured meshes with polyhedral elements in the Silo database reader.</li>
</ul>
