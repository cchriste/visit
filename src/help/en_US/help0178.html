<h2><p>Changing elevation height</h2></p>
<p>The Elevate operator uses a scalar variable's data values as the Z component when converting a mesh's 2D coordinates into 3D coordinates. When the scalar variable's data extents are small relative to the mesh's X and Y extents then you often get what appears to be a flat 2D version of the data floating in 3D space. It is sometimes necessary to scale the scalar variable's data extents relative to the spatial extents in order to produce a visualization where the Z value differs noticeably. If you want to exaggerate the Z values that the scalar variable contributes to make differences more obvious, you can click on the <b>Elevation height relative to XY limits</b> check box in the <b>Elevate operator attributes window</b>.</p>
