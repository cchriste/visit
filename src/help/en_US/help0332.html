<h2>Deleting an expression</h2>
<p>
You can delete an expression by clicking on it in the <b>Expression list</b> and then clicking on the <b>Delete</b> button. Deleting an expression removes it from the list of defined expressions and will cause unresolved references for any other expression that uses the deleted expression. If a plot uses an expression with unresolved references, VisIt will not be able to generate it until you resolve the reference or change the active plot variable.
