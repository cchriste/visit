<h2>Altering an existing database correlation</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure15"></a><img src="../images/MultipleDatabaseAndWindows/altercorrelation.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 15</i></td></tr></table></center><br>Once you've created a database correlation, you can alter it at any time by highlighting it in the <b>Correlation</b> list in the <b>Database Correlation Window </b>and clicking the <b>Edit</b> button to the left of the <b>Correlation</b> list. Clicking the <b>Edit</b> button opens the <b>Database Correlation Properties Window</b> and allows you to change the correlation method and the input databases. Once you've made the desired changes, clicking the <b>Alter database correlation </b>button will make the specified database correlation use the new options and all plots in all vis windows that are subject to the changed database correlation will update to the new time states prescribed by the altered database correlation.
</p>
<p>
Using the <b>Database Correlation Properties Window</b> explicitly alters a database correlation. Reopening a file or refreshing the file list can implicitly alter a database correlation if after reopening the affected databases, there are different numbers of time states in the databases. When reopened databases that are input databases to database correlations have a new number of time states, VisIt recalculates the indices used to access the input databases via the time slider and updates any plots that were affected. In addition to the time state indices changing, the number of time states in the database correlation and its time slider can also change.
