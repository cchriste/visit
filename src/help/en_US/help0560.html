<h2>File panel time display</h2>
<p>
The databases shown in the <b>File panel's Selected files</b> list show database cycles to indicate when databases are comprised of multiple time states. Cycles are shown by default because they can often be guessed from numbers embedded in the files that make up each time state in the database. When you open a time-varying database that was written in a file format that natively understands multiple time states, VisIt can show cycles, times, or both in the time state's name.

If you want times to be shown in a time state's name, click the <b>Times</b> radio button. If VisIt cannot successfully retrieve the times for each time state from your database then many of the times will have a question mark instead of a valid time. If you want to display both cycles and times in a time state's name, click the <b>Cycles and times</b> radio button. If you choose to include times in the name of a time state, you can set the number of significant digits to be shown in the time state's label. Enter a new number of significant digits into the <b>Number of significant digits</b> spin box if you want to increase or decrease the precision used in displaying the times.

<p>
Once you've chosen cycles, times, or both to be part of the information shown for each time state in a time-varying database, you can enter the selected type of time information into the <b>Cycle/Time</b> text field in order to change time states to the time state that closest matches the time state that you entered. That means that if you chose to display time in the name of a database time state, you can enter time into the <b>Cycle/Time</b> text field in order to change time states. figure shows what the <b>Selected files</b> list looks like when you've chosen different <b>File panel</b> time display options.
