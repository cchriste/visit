<h2>Changing view perspective</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure15"></a><img src="../images/VisualizationWindows/perspective.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 15</i></td></tr></table></center><br>When the vis window contains 3D plots, the perspective setting can be used to enhance how 3D the plot looks. In a perspective projection, graphics grow smaller as they recede into the distance which makes them look more realistic. To change the perspective setting, click on the <b>Perspective</b> option in the <b>Popup menu's</b> <b>View</b> menu (see figure). When the vis window uses a perspective projection, the Popup menu's Perspective option will have a selection rectangle around its icon. You can also turn perspective on or off by clicking on the <b>Perspective icon</b> in the <b>Toolbar</b>. The difference in appearance having perspective and not having it is shown in figure.
