<h2>Clearing pick points</h2>
<p>
Click on the <b>Clear</b> menu's <b>Clear pick points </b>option if you want to remove all of the pick labels that were added when you picked on the plots in the vis window. Clearing the pick points also removes any pick information related to those pick points in the <b>Pick</b> window.
