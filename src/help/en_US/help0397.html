<h2>Changing the background style</h2>
<p>
VisIt has two possible background styles from which to choose. The default background style is solid where the entire background is a single color. Another background style is a gradient background. In a gradient background, two colors are blended into each other in various ways. The resulting background offers differing degrees of contrast and can enhance the look of many visualizations. To change the background style, click the <b>Background style</b> radio buttons in the <b>Annotation Window</b>. Choosing <b>Solid</b> selects a solid background while choosing <b>Gradient</b> selects a gradient background.
