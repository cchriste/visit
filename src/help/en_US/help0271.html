<h2><p>Pick mode</h2></p>
<p>When a vis window is in pick mode, any click with the left mouse button causes VisIt to calculate the value of the plot at the clicked point and place a pick point marker in the vis window to indicate where you clicked. The calculated value is printed to the <b>Output Window</b> and the <b>Pick Window</b>.</p>
