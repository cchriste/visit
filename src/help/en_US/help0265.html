<h2><p>Copying window attributes</h2></p>
<p>VisIt allows you to copy window attributes and plots from one window to another when you have more than one window. This can be useful when you are comparing plots generated from similar databases. The <b>Copy</b> menu, shown in Figure6-5, contains options to copy the view, lighting, annotations, plots, or everything from other from other vis windows. Under each option, the <b>Copy</b> menu provides a list of available vis windows from which attributes can be copied so, for example, if you have two windows and you want to copy the view from vis window 1 into vis window 2, you can select the <b>Window 2</b> option from the <b>View from</b> submenu. The list of available windows depends on the vis windows that you have created. You can copy the lighting from one window to another window by using the <b>Lighting from</b> submenu or you can use the <b>Annotations from</b> or <b>Plots from</b> to copy the annotations or plots, respectively. If you make a selection from the <b>Everything from</b> submenu, all attributes and plots are copied into the active vis window.</p>
