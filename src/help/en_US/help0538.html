<h2>Setting the machine file</h2>
<p>
Some compute environments use machine files, text files that contain the names of the nodes to use for executing a parallel job, when running a parallel job. If you are running VisIt in such an environment, the <b>Engine option window</b> provides a text field called <b>Machine file</b>. The <b>Machine file</b> text field allows you to enter the name of a new machine file if you want to override which machine file is used for the selected host profile. The <b>Machine file</b> text field is only enabled when the <b>Default Machine File</b> check box is enabled in the <b>Host profile Window's</b> parallel options.
