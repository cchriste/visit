<a name="General_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
</ul>

<a name="Advanced_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced features added in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li>VisIt now supports hardware based rendering for clusters with
        multiple GPUs per node.  The previous <tt>-hw-accel</tt>
        interface is preserved.  Therefore no host profile
        modifications will be necessary, but you must update your VisIt
        host profiles if you'd like to use more than one GPU.
        For full information, see
        <a href="http://www.visitusers.org/index.php?title=Parallel_Hardware_Acceleration">
        the wiki</a>.
</ul>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Silo reader causes a crash when reading multimat objects whose
material entries are all set to "EMPTY".</li>
<li>The PDB/Flash file reader has been changed so that it does not allow VisIt to
    cache data since the reader performs its own caching.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Plot_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's plots in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
      <li>The Streamline plot has three new color by options: time, arc
          length and seed point id.</li>
      <li>The Spreadsheet plot now prints an informational message in text files
          that it saves so the user knows that the vertical ordering of data
          in the file differs from what is shown in</li>
</ul>

<a name="Operator_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's operators in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The InverseGhostZone operator now operates correctly on blocks that have
no ghost zones.</li>
<li>Deleting an operator by clicking the red X in the plot list now works for
plots that are not selected.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Expression_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's expression language in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
</ul>

<a name="Query_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's picks and queries in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed more cases of failure in the NumNodes query.</li>
<li>VisIt no longer crashes when performing a query over time for the PickByNode 
    and PickByZone queries if you accidentally apply the queries to a Mesh plot.</li>
</ul>

<a name="CLI_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's command-line interface in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
</ul>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Other bugs fixed in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
      <li>A bug was fixed with Fedora Core 9 where "Save Window" and images from
          "Scalable rendering mode" ("SR mode")
          were coming out corrupted.</li>

      <li>SR mode now detects when only the root process creates an image, and
          adjusts composition appropriately.  This fixes a bug which caused the
          volume plot to create images with visible slices.</li>

      <li>Fixed the usage of the loopback device (127.0.0.1) for Windows.</li>

      <li>Fixed a small memory leak on Windows platfrom.</li>

      <li>The parallel compute engine wrapper library has been linked with the cognomen library, allowing it to work in parallel with libsim once more.</li>

      <li>VisIt's expression evaluator frees up more problem-sized memory as it evaluates expressions, making it less likely that the compute engine will run out of memory.</li>

      <li>The CLI's OpenGUI() function causes the viewer to crash when the viewer is run without a window using the <i>-nowin</i> command line argument.</li>

      <li>The "visit -movie" script does not properly handle engine launch arguments.</li>

      <li>VisIt's Save Movie wizard no longer presents "Streaming movie" as an option unless the img2sm encoding software exists in your path.</li>

      <li>Modified the component launcher code on windows to not override
          VISITSSH or VISITSSHARGS if set in the users's environment.</li>

      <li>Made available once again the ability for the windows installer
          to copy over old config files to the new version</li>

      <li>VisIt no longer reverts to displaying files from your home directory when the
          <i>-launchengine</i> argument is added to the command line as a result of adding
          parallel command line arguments such as <i>-np, -nn</i>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Config_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to configuration files in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
      <li>The host profiles for ORNL's visualization cluster, lens, was updated
          to include support for launching multi-GPU parallel engines.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
      <li>Project files for VC 8 were updated to allow successful compilation
          in parallel.</li>
      <li>VisIt now tries to compile and link with a shared hdf5 library.</li>
      <li>VisIt binary distributions will use a shared hdf5 library.</li>
      <li>VisIt no longer requires Silo in order to compile.</li>
      <li>--with-szip configuration option has been removed because VisIt does
          not directly depend on the szip library. It may, however, depend on
          szip indirectly (see below).</li>
      <li>--with-hdf5 option supports specification of additional libraries upon
            which hdf5 depends by using a colon (':') separator followed by a
            comma separated list of flags to link against hdf5.</li>
      <li>Config site file symbols for HDF5 changed to DEFAULT_HDF5_LIBLOC and,
          optionally, DEFAULT_HDF5_LIBDEP. See confit-site/hoth.llnl.gov.conf
          for an example.</li>
      <li>New VAC_ARG_WITH3RD autoconf macro should be used to handle third
          party libraries.</li>
