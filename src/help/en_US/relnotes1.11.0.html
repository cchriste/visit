<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Announcements</font></b></p>
<ul>
   <li>The VisIt 1.11 release was made on an abbreviated schedule.  Our project decided to make this release early to 
       catch up to our regular release schedule, which had slipped with the 1.10 release.  We strive to have four major
       releases per year.</li>
</ul>

<!--
<p><b><font size="4">Announcements</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The VisIt team released a patch release, <a
    href="relnotes1.11.1.html">version 1.11.1</a>, to fix some critical
    defects that surfaced in the VisIt 1.11 release.  Descriptions of
    the defects addressed by the patch release can be found in the <a
    href="relnotes1.11.1.html">VisIt 1.11.1 release notes</a>.  All
    version 1.11.1 fixes are included in this release.</li>

<a name="General_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The mesh plot was greatly tuned for rectilinear meshes, including 
      AMR rectilinear meshes. You should see considerable improvement in 
      both performance and memory footprint.</li>
  <li>The material interface reconstruction was tuned for the case of a domain
      that has only a single material. Again, you should see considerable
      improvement in both performance and memory footprint.</li>
  <li>You can now change legends to have a horizontal orientation, as opposed
      to the traditional vertical orientation. To access the controls (as
      well as other legend controls), bring up the <i>Annotation</i> window
      by selecting the <i>Controls->Annotation</i> menu entry in the main
      GUI and look under the <i>Objects</i> tab.</li>
  <li>The 3d axes have been enhanced to allow the user to specify the major
      and minor tick mark locations for each of the axes. In order to set
      them bring up the <i>Annotation</i> window, select the <i>3D</i> tab,
      turn off the <i>Auto set ticks</i> button, and then specify the major
      tick mark minimum, major tick mark maxium, minor tick mark spacing and
      major tick mark spacing for each of the axes.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Advanced_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced features added in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt now supports hardware based rendering for clusters with
      multiple GPUs per node. The previous <tt>-hw-accel</tt> interface
      is preserved. Therefore no host profile modifications will be
      necessary, but you must update your VisIt host profiles if you'd
      like to use more than one GPU. For full information, see the wiki
      page: http://www.visitusers.org/index.php?title=Parallel_Hardware_Acceleration.
  </li>
  <li>Libsim.a is now being compiled with the flags "-fPIC", so that it is
      possible to build a shared library from it.</li>
</ul>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ralph Bruckschen contributed the new Gadget file reader for data from
      the Gadget 2 cosmological N-body/SPH simulation code. Thank you, Ralph!</li>
  <li>The Silo reader no longer crashes when reading multimat objects whose
      material entries are all set to "EMPTY".</li>
  <li>The PDB/Flash file reader has been changed so that it does not allow
      VisIt to cache data since the reader performs its own caching.</li>
  <li>The Silo reader now supports decomposed domain boundaries for
      Rectilinear meshes.</li>
  <li>The configuration for the ITAPS reader has changed to support multiple
      implementations of ITAPS libraries in one installation of VisIt. The
      new configuration switch is --with-itaps-impls=[very long string]
      which defines all the features of each ITAPS implementation VisIt is
      to be compiled with. Each implementation leads to an ITAPS database
      reader plugin with a different name. See DEFAULT_ITAPS_IMPLS
      specification in config-site/hoth.llnl.gov for further explanation
      and an example.</li>
  <li>The MFIX reader will now work correctly when run on a big-endian
      machine. The reader still assumes the data file is big-endian. If this is
      not the case, the user can tell VisIt this via the Database Options
      available when opening the file.</li> 
  <li>The PlainText reader now supports curves where any column can
      represent the abscissa.</li>
  <li>The Tecplot file format now supports cell-centered variables (through
      the VARLOCATION keyword).</li>
  <li>The SAMRAI reader now works on Windows.</li>
  <li>The Dune reader has been fixed to work on Windows.</li> 
  <li>Reading virtual databases of FLASH format data now works on Windows.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Plot_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's plots in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Volume plot's ray-casting option now has a lighting model. This 
      results in significantly higher quality pictures, at the cost of more 
      computation time. To use the old (faster) way, disable lighting in the
      plot options.</li>
  <li>The Streamline plot has three new color by options: time, arc length
      and seed point id.</li>
  <li>The Volume plot's ray-casting option no longer has additional,
      unnecessary executions when making its first image.</li>
  <li>The Spreadsheet plot now prints an informational message in text files
      that it saves so the user knows that the vertical ordering of data
      in the file differs from what is shown in the plot.</li>
  <li>The Volume plot can now directly volume render unsigned character data
      with no intermediate representations, meaning that the memory footprint
      will now be lower in this case.</li>
  <li>The Molecule plot no longer shortens bonds in degenerate cases.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Operator_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's operators in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The InverseGhostZone operator now operates correctly on blocks that
      have no ghost zones.</li>
  <li>The Slice operator now labels axes differently when projecting to two
      dimensions. It has always correctly labeled the axes when doing
      orthogonal slices. However, for non-orthogonal slices, it was
      consistently labeling the axes as <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>, even though
      those were not the true axes. It will now label the axes with the true
      axes, for example the <i>0.707,0,-0.707 Axis</i>.</li>
  <li>Deleting an operator by clicking the red X in the plot list now works
      for plots that are not selected.</li>
  <li>The Tube operator can now scale the tube by a scalar variable.</li>
  <li>The Tube operator now successfully works on line segments that form
      loops, where these segments would previously be ignored.</li>
  <li>The Threshold operator now issues a warning if you are thresholding by
      the <i>default</i> variable and that variable is not a scalar.</li>
  <li>When the Slice operator is projecting to two dimensions and the slice
      plane is set using the theta-phi method, users can now set the up-axis
      for projection to two dimensions.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Expression_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's expression language in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Extra logic was added to the conn_components expression to to validate
      ghost zones before attempting to use the ghost zone neighbors
      optimization.</li>
  <li>Recursive expressions no longer kill the engine.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Query_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's picks and queries in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed more cases of failure in the NumNodes query.</li>
  <li>VisIt no longer crashes when performing a query over time for the
      PickByNode and PickByZone queries if you accidentally apply the queries
      to a Mesh plot.</li>
  <li>Fixed an error in the GUI with parsing the output file name for the
      "Connected Components Summary" Query.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Other bugs fixed in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt should be significantly better at cleaning up runaway parallel
      engines.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed with Fedora Core 9 where "Save Window" and images from
      "Scalable rendering mode" ("SR mode") were coming out corrupted.</li>
  <li>SR mode now detects when only the root process creates an image, and
      adjusts composition appropriately. This fixes a bug which caused the
      volume plot to create images with visible slices.</li>
  <li>If file grouping is set to <i>off</i> and you connect to a remote host,
      the files on the remote machine now display correctly, where previously
      it would appear as an empty list.</li>
  <li>Fixed the usage of the loopback device (127.0.0.1) for Windows.</li>
  <li>Fixed a small memory leak on the Windows platfrom.</li>
  <li>The parallel compute engine wrapper library has been linked with the
      cognomen library, allowing it to work in parallel with libsim once
      more.</li>
  <li>VisIt's expression evaluator frees up more problem-sized memory as it
      evaluates expressions, making it less likely that the compute engine
      will run out of memory.</li>
  <li>The CLI's OpenGUI() function no longer causes the viewer to crash when
      the viewer is run without a window using the <i>-nowin</i> command line
      argument.</li>
  <li>The "visit -movie" script now properly handles engine launch
      arguments.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Save Movie wizard no longer presents "Streaming movie" as an
      option unless the img2sm encoding software exists in your path.</li>
  <li>Modified the component launcher code on windows to not override
      VISITSSH or VISITSSHARGS if set in the users's environment.</li>
  <li>The windows installer once again allows the user to copy over old
      config files to the new version.</li>
  <li>VisIt no longer reverts to displaying files from your home directory
      when the <i>-launchengine</i> argument is added to the command line as
      a result of adding parallel command line arguments such as <i>-np, -nn</i>.</li>
  <li>Replaced the use of bzip2 compression with libz compression for data sent
      from engine to viewer. Empirical results show better compression and
      performance with libz.</li>
  <li>A significant memory bloat was found and fixed for the case of 
      processing double precision data.</li>
  <li>SIL correctness checking was modified to keep enumerated scalar
      selection from influencing material selection. This resolves an issue
      with selecting materials when Nodelists are present.  </li>
  <li>Restoring sessions while running remotely via cygwin or XWin32 will
      no longer cause the main GUI window to be un-sizeable.</li>
  <li>The legend font height can now be set using the Python interface's legend
      annotation object.</li>
  <li>The Windows version is no longer missing some LLNL host profiles.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Config_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to configuration files in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The host profiles for ORNL's visualization cluster, lens, was updated
      to include support for launching multi-GPU parallel engines.</li>
  <li>Host profiles for LLNL's juno and eos systems have been added.</li>
  <li>Host profiles for LLNL's tempest machine have been added.</li>
  <li>The host profiles for LLNL's purple, um and uv systems have been
      modified to use SLURM and Moab.</li>
  <li>The host profiles for the LANL Q machine were removed since it no
      longer exists.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Project files for VC 8 were updated to allow successful compilation
      in parallel.</li>
  <li>VisIt now tries to compile and link with a shared hdf5 library.</li>
  <li>VisIt binary distributions will use a shared hdf5 library.</li>
  <li>VisIt no longer requires Silo in order to compile.</li>
  <li>--with-szip configuration option has been removed because VisIt does
      not directly depend on the szip library. It may, however, depend on
      szip indirectly (see below).</li>
  <li>--with-hdf5 option supports specification of additional libraries upon
        which hdf5 depends by using a colon (':') separator followed by a
        comma separated list of flags to link against hdf5.</li>
  <li>Config site file symbols for HDF5 changed to DEFAULT_HDF5_LIBLOC and,
      optionally, DEFAULT_HDF5_LIBDEP. See confit-site/hoth.llnl.gov.conf
      for an example.</li>
  <li>New VAC_ARG_WITH3RD autoconf macro should be used to handle third
      party libraries.</li>
  <li>libz was added as a third party builtin and bzip2 was removed.</li>
  <li>The build_visit script was refactored so that all patch code is now
      cleanly isolated into their own separate function.</li>
