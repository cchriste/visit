<a name="General_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Mesh plots were greatly tuned for rectilinear meshes, including 
      AMR rectilinear meshes.  You should see considerable improvement in 
      both performance and memory footprint.</li>
  <li>Material interface reconstruction was tuned for the case of a domain
      that has only a single material.  Again, you should see considerable
      improvement in both performance and memory footprint.</li>
  <li>You can now change legends to have a horizontal orientation, as opposed
      to the traditional vertical orientation.  To access the controls (as
      well as other legend controls), go to Controls->Annotations in the main
      GUI and look under the Objects tab.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Advanced_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced features added in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li>VisIt now supports hardware based rendering for clusters with
        multiple GPUs per node.  The previous <tt>-hw-accel</tt>
        interface is preserved.  Therefore no host profile
        modifications will be necessary, but you must update your VisIt
        host profiles if you'd like to use more than one GPU.
        For full information, see
        <a href="http://www.visitusers.org/index.php?title=Parallel_Hardware_Acceleration">
        the wiki</a>.
</ul>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Silo reader causes a crash when reading multimat objects whose
material entries are all set to "EMPTY".</li>
<li>The PDB/Flash file reader has been changed so that it does not allow VisIt to
    cache data since the reader performs its own caching.</li>
<li>The Silo reader now supports decomposed domain boundaries for Rectilinear meshes.</li>
<li>Configuration for the ITAPS reader has changed to support multiple implementations
    of ITAPS libraries in one installation of VisIt. The new configuration switch
    is --with-itaps-impls=[very long string] which defines all the features of
    each ITAPS implementation VisIt is to be compiled with. Each implementation leads
    to an ITAPS database reader plugin with a different name. See DEFAULT_ITAPS_IMPLS
    specification in config-site/hoth.llnl.gov for further explanation and example.
    cache data since the reader performs its own caching.</li>
<li>The MFIX reader will now work correctly when run on a big-endian machine.  
    The reader still assumes data file is big-endian.  If this is not the case, 
    the user can tell VisIt this via the Database Options available when 
    opening the file.</li> 
<li>PlainText reader now supports curves where any column can represent the abscissa.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Plot_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's plots in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
      <li>The Volume plot's ray-casting option now has a lighting model.  This 
          results in significantly higher quality pictures, at the cost of more 
          computation time.  To use the old (faster) way, disable lighting
          in the plot options.</li>
      <li>The Streamline plot has three new color by options: time, arc
          length and seed point id.</li>
      <li>The Volume plot's ray-casting option no longer has additional, unnecessary
          executions when making its first image.</li>
      <li>The Spreadsheet plot now prints an informational message in text files
          that it saves so the user knows that the vertical ordering of data
          in the file differs from what is shown in</li>
      <li>The Volume plot can now directly volume render unsigned character data with no intermediate
          representations, meaning that the memory footprint will now be lower in this case.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Operator_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's operators in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The InverseGhostZone operator now operates correctly on blocks that have
no ghost zones.</li>
<li>The Slice operator now labels axes differently when projecting to two dimensions.
It has always correctly labeled the axes when doing orthogonal slices.  However, for
non-orthogonal slices, it was consistently labeling the axes as <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>, even
though those were not the true axes.  It will now label the axes with
the true axes, for example the <i>0.707,0,-0.707 Axis</i>.</li>
<li>Deleting an operator by clicking the red X in the plot list now works for
plots that are not selected.</li>
<li>The Tube operator now successfully works on line segments that form loops,
where these segments would previously be ignored.</li>
<li>The Threshold operator now issues a warning if you are thresholding by the
<i>default</i> variable and that variable is not a scalar.</li>
<li>When the Slice operator is projecting to two dimensions and the slice plane is
set using the theta-phi method, users can now set the up-axis for projection to
two dimensions.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Expression_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's expression language in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Extra logic was added to the conn_components expression to to validate ghost zones before
attempting to use the ghost zone neighbors optimization.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="Query_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's picks and queries in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed more cases of failure in the NumNodes query.</li>
<li>VisIt no longer crashes when performing a query over time for the PickByNode 
    and PickByZone queries if you accidentally apply the queries to a Mesh plot.</li>
<li>Fixed an error in the GUI with parsing the output file name for the "Connected Components 
Summary" Query.</li>
</ul>

<a name="CLI_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's command-line interface in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
</ul>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Other bugs fixed in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
      <li>VisIt should be significantly better at cleaning up runaway parallel engines.</li>

      <li>A bug was fixed with Fedora Core 9 where "Save Window" and images from
          "Scalable rendering mode" ("SR mode")
          were coming out corrupted.</li>

      <li>SR mode now detects when only the root process creates an image, and
          adjusts composition appropriately.  This fixes a bug which caused the
          volume plot to create images with visible slices.</li>

      <li>If file grouping is set to <i>off</i> and you connect to a remote host,
          the files on the remote machine now display correctly, where previously
          it would appear as an empty list.</li>
      <li>Fixed the usage of the loopback device (127.0.0.1) for Windows.</li>

      <li>Fixed a small memory leak on Windows platfrom.</li>

      <li>The parallel compute engine wrapper library has been linked with the cognomen library, allowing it to work in parallel with libsim once more.</li>

      <li>VisIt's expression evaluator frees up more problem-sized memory as it evaluates expressions, making it less likely that the compute engine will run out of memory.</li>

      <li>The CLI's OpenGUI() function causes the viewer to crash when the viewer is run without a window using the <i>-nowin</i> command line argument.</li>

      <li>The "visit -movie" script does not properly handle engine launch arguments.</li>

      <li>VisIt's Save Movie wizard no longer presents "Streaming movie" as an option unless the img2sm encoding software exists in your path.</li>

      <li>Modified the component launcher code on windows to not override
          VISITSSH or VISITSSHARGS if set in the users's environment.</li>

      <li>Made available once again the ability for the windows installer
          to copy over old config files to the new version</li>

      <li>VisIt no longer reverts to displaying files from your home directory when the
          <i>-launchengine</i> argument is added to the command line as a result of adding
          parallel command line arguments such as <i>-np, -nn</i>.</li>

      <li>Replaced use of bzip2 compression with libz compression for data sent from engine
          to viewer. Empirical results show better compression and performance with libz.</li>

      <li>A significant memory bloat was found and fixed for the case of 
          processing double precision data.</li>
      <li>SIL correctness checking was modified to keep enumerated scalar selection from influencing material selection.
      This resolves an issue with selecting materials when Nodelists are present.
      </li>
      <li>Restoring sessions while running remotely via cygwin or XWin32 will
          no longer cause main GUI window to be un-sizeable.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Config_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to configuration files in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
      <li>The host profiles for ORNL's visualization cluster, lens, was updated
          to include support for launching multi-GPU parallel engines.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 1.11</font></b></p>
<ul>
      <li>Project files for VC 8 were updated to allow successful compilation
          in parallel.</li>
      <li>VisIt now tries to compile and link with a shared hdf5 library.</li>
      <li>VisIt binary distributions will use a shared hdf5 library.</li>
      <li>VisIt no longer requires Silo in order to compile.</li>
      <li>--with-szip configuration option has been removed because VisIt does
          not directly depend on the szip library. It may, however, depend on
          szip indirectly (see below).</li>
      <li>--with-hdf5 option supports specification of additional libraries upon
            which hdf5 depends by using a colon (':') separator followed by a
            comma separated list of flags to link against hdf5.</li>
      <li>Config site file symbols for HDF5 changed to DEFAULT_HDF5_LIBLOC and,
          optionally, DEFAULT_HDF5_LIBDEP. See confit-site/hoth.llnl.gov.conf
          for an example.</li>
      <li>New VAC_ARG_WITH3RD autoconf macro should be used to handle third
          party libraries.</li>
      <li>libz was added as a third party builtin and bzip2 was removed.</li>
      <li>The build_visit script was refactored so that all patch code is now cleanly isolated 
          into their own separate function.</li>
