<h2>Lighting</h2>
<p>
Lighting adds detail and depth, two characteristics that are important for animations, to the Surface plot. You can click the <b>Lighting</b> check box in the lower part of the <b>Surface plot attributes window</b> to turn lighting on and off. Since lighting is on by default, uncheck the <b>Lighting</b> check box to turn lighting off.
