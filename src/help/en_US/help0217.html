<h2><p>SphereSlice operator</h2></p>
<p>The SphereSlice operator slices a 2D or 3D database with an arbitrary sphere. Plots to which the SphereSlice operator have been applied become 2D surfaces that are coincident with the surface of the slicing sphere. The resulting plots remain in 3D space. You can use the SphereSlice operator to slice objects to judge their deviation from being perfectly spherical. An example of the SphereSlice operator is shown in Figure4-52.</p>
