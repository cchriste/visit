<h2>Setting point properties</h2>
<p>
Albeit rare, the Subset plot can be used to plot points that belong to different subsets so the <b>Subset plot attributes window</b> provides controls that allow you to set the representation and size of the points. You can change the points' representation using the <b>Point Type</b> combo box. The available options are: <b>Box</b>, <b>Axis</b>, <b>Icosahedron</b>, <b>Point</b>, and <b>Sphere</b>. To change the size of the points, you can enter a new floating point value into the <b>Point size</b> text field. Finally, you can opt to scale the points' glyphs using a scalar expression by turning on the <b>Scale point size by variable</b> check box and by selecting a scalar variable from the <b>Variable</b> button to the right of that check box.
