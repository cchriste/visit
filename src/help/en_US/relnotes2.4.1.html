<li>Simulations that use an absolute path to their .sim2 file now show the current time in the Simulations window.</li>

<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.4.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>VisIt can now tunnel data connections through ssh when a gateway machine is used to connect to a remote computer. For example, Windows computers can use this feature to connect to remote computers through a gateway even if the Windows firewall does not permit exceptions for VisIt's ports <i>(5600-5610)</i>.</li>
<li>Libsim was enhanced so variable metadata objects can be hidden from the gui so variables cannot be plotted directly.</li>
<li>VisIt and Libsim were enhanced to support array variables.</li>
<li>The Dyna3D reader was enhanced so it can read a new style of control information.</li>
<li>Caching behavior was improved for the class of file format readers which incorporate optimizations, such as reading only a portion of the data, directly into the read process.</li>
</ul>
