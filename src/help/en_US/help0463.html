<h2>Saving session</h2>
<p>
Once you have set up your plots, you can select <b>Save session</b> option in the <b>Main Window's File</b> menu to open up a <b>Save file </b>dialog. Once the <b>Save file</b> dialog is opened, select the location and filename that you want to use to store the session file. By default, VisIt stores all session files in your .visit directory on UNIX and MacOS X computers and in the directory where VisIt was installed on Windows computers. Once you select the location and filename to use when saving the session file, VisIt writes an XML description of the complete state of all vis windows, plots, and GUI windows into the session file so the next time you come into VisIt, you can completely restore your VisIt session.
