<h2><p>Command Window</h2></p>
<p>It is possible for VisIt's GUI and Python Interface to share the same viewer component at runtime. When you invoke visit at the command line, VisIt's GUI is launched. When you invoke visit -cli at the command line, VisIt's CLI (Python interface) is launched. If you want to use both components simultaneously then you can use VisIt's <b>Command Window</b>. The <b>Command Window</b> can be opened by clicking on the <b>Command</b> menu option in the <b>Main Window's Controls menu</b>. The <b>Command Window</b> consists of a set of eight tabs in which you can type Python scripts. When you type a Python script into one of the tabs, you can then click the tab's <b>Execute</b> button to make VisIt try and interpret your Python code. If VisIt detects that it has no Python interpreting service available, it will launch the CLI (connected to the same viewer component) and then tell the CLI to execute your Python code. Note that the <b>Command Window</b> is just for editing Python scripts. Any output that results from the Python code's execution will be displayed in the CLI program window (see Figure10-5).</p>
