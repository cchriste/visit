<h2>Concise pick output</h2>
<p>
Pick returns a lot of information when you pick on a plot. The <b>Pick Window</b> usually displays the pick output one item per line, which can end up taking a lot of vertical space. If you want to condense the information into a smaller area, click the <b>Concise output</b> check box. Sometimes, not all of the information is relevant for your analysis so VisIt provides options to hide certain items in the pick output. If you don't want VisIt to display the name of the picked mesh, turn off the <b>Show Mesh Name</b> check box. If you don't want VisIt to show the time state, turn of the <b>Show timestep </b>check box.
