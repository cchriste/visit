<h2>Picking a compute engine</h2>
<p>
The <b>Compute Engine Window</b> has the concept of an active compute engine. Only the active compute engine's progress is displayed in the status bars. The active compute engine is also the engine that is interrupted or closed. To pick a new active compute engine, choose a compute engine name from the <b>Engine</b> menu. The <b>Engine</b> menu contains the names of all compute engines that VisIt is running.
