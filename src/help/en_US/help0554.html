<h2><p>Plugin Manager Window</h2></p>
<p>The <b>Plugin Manager Window</b>, shown in Figure14-6, allows you to see which plugins are available for plots, operators, and databases. Not all plugins have to be loaded, in fact, many operator plugins are not loaded by default. The <b>Plugin Manager Window</b> allows you to specify which plugins are loaded when VisIt is started. The <b>Plugin Manager Window</b> is activated from the <b>Main Window's Options</b> menu after clicking on the <b>Plugin Manager</b> option.</p>
