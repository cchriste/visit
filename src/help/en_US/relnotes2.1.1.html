<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 2.1.1 is primarily a bug fix release to release 2.1. It fixes additional bugs in release 2.1. Look <a href="relnotes2.1.0.html">here</a> to see a complete list of changes in release 2.1.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.1.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>When you save a window using the <b>Screen ratio</b> option, the image should match what you see on the screen much better.</li>
<li>Saving movies using "movie templates" is now fixed.</li>
<li>Clicking <b>Print</b> in the Print dialog now prints on all platforms.</li>
<li>The molecule plot now correctly uses 'sphere imposters' in scalable
rendering mode.</li>
<li>The FVCOM reader can group files again.</li>
<li>The <i>-viewer_geometry</i> argument works again, letting you tell VisIt where to place the viewer windows.</li>
<LI>Position independent code is forced when building Mesa, as a workaround for build that appeared on 32bit
SELinux-enabled systems.</LI>
<LI>Some streamline plot memory corruption issues affecting
    <A HREF="http://visitbugs.ornl.gov/issues/368">issue 368</A> have been
    corrected.</LI>
<li>The <i>Reverse, Turn all on, Turn all off</i> buttons in the Subset window now take effect immediately when the <i>Auto apply</i> setting is enabled.</li>
<li>The DataBinning operator now can be used in conjunction with the Contour plot and the Volume plot.</li>
<li><i>Save Session</i> and <i>Save Settings</i> will now work correctly for the DataBinning, AMRStitchCell,
    DeformSphereGlyph, Delaunay, and Edge operators.</li>
<li>The PersistentParticles operator now works in conjunction with <i>Selections</i> for all data.  (It previously
    only worked with FastBit data.)</li>
<li>Banks can now be correctly specified on Argonne's Eureka machine.</li>
<li>An indexing problem for the SetWindowMode in the Python interface was corrected.</li>
<li>The Label plot can now set text heights that are fractional percents.  Meaning 1.5% is now possible, where only 1% and 2% were possible through the GUI previously.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed that prevented saving movies with old session files.</li>
<li>If you run the Streamline plot on an empty data set, it no longer crashes.</li>
<li>Expressions that extract vectors from tensor data now work correctly for 2D data.</li>
<li>Making movies once again can obtain the engine launch parameters from a session file. This fixes the movie-making case where you want to use a new instance of VisIt or if you want VisIt to tell you the command to run.</li>
<li>Quoting for string data in saved settings has been eliminated except for strings that contain spaces. This more closely matches VisIt's old behavior, improving compatibility with older versions of VisIt.</li>
<li>Cracks Clipper operator works again.</li>
<li>The embedded viewer example program now works on Windows.</li>
<li>The Windows installer now checks for previous versions of VisIt in the PATH environment variable, and removes them if user so chooses.</li>
<li>SimV2 can better deal with 2-element arrays when setting real indices and base indices for rectilinear meshes.</li>
