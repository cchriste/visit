<h2>Creating a plot</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure2"></a><img src="../images/Plots/plotmenu.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 2</i></td></tr></table></center><br>To use any of VisIt's capabilities, you must know how to create a plot. First, make sure you have opened a database. To open a database, double-click on the database name in the <b>Selected files list</b>. After opening a database, use the <b>Plots</b> menu to create a plot. To activate the <b>Plots</b> menu, click on the <b>Plots</b> option in the <b>Plots and Operators</b> menu shown in figure.
</p>
<p>
Selecting the <b>Plots</b> menu pops up a list of VisIt plot types. Plots for which the open database has no data are disabled. If a plot type is enabled, pulling the mouse toward the right while holding down the left button shows which variables can be plotted. Release the mouse button when the mouse cursor is over the variable that you want to plot, and a new plot list entry will appear in the <b>Plot</b> <b>list</b>. The new plot list entry will be colored green in the plot list until VisIt is told to draw when you click the <b>Draw</b> button. The <b>Plots</b> menu is disabled until a database is open.
