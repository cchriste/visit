<h2>Choosing the active light</h2>
<p>
The active light is the light whose properties are shown in the <b>Lighting Window</b>. Only the active light can be modified so you must switch active lights each time you want to make changes to a light. To change the active light, select a new light from the <b>Active light</b> pulldown (figure). The <b>Active light</b> pulldown contains a list of eight possible lights of which only light 1 is active by default. When a light is active, it has a small light bulb icon next to it. Inactive lights have no light bulb icon. Once a new light has been selected from the <b>Active light</b> pulldown, its properties are displayed in the <b>Lighting Window's Properties</b> panel.
