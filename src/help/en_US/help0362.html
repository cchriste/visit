<h2>Automatically showing the Pick Window</h2>
<p>
When you pick on a plot, VisIt automatically opens the <b>Pick Window</b> to display the results of the pick operation. You can prevent VisIt from automatically showing the <b>Pick Window</b> after a pick operation by turning off the <b>Automatically show window</b> check box in the <b>Pick Window</b>. If the <b>Pick Window</b> does not automatically appear after picking then you can turn on the <b>Automatically show window</b> check box.
