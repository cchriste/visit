<h2>Saving binary geometry files</h2>
<p>
Some geometry file formats such as <i>STL</i> and <i>VTK</i> have both ASCII and binary versions of the file format. The ASCII file formats are human-readable and are larger and more complex for programs to process than binary formats, which are not human-readable but are smaller and easier for programs to read. When geometry file formats support both ASCII and binary formats, the<b> Save Window's Binary</b> check box is enabled. By default VisIt writes ASCII geometry files but you can click the <b>Binary</b> check box to make VisIt write binary geometry files.
