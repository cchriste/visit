<h2><p>Changing hosts</h2></p>
<p>One of VisIt's strengths is its ability to operate on files that exist on remote computers. The default host is: "localhost", which is a name understood by the system to be the name of your local computer. To access the files on a remote computer, you must provide the name of the remote computer in the <b>Host</b> text field by either typing the name of a remote computer and pressing the Enter key or by selecting a remote computer from the list of recently visited hosts. To access the list of recently visited hosts, click on the down-arrow at the far right of the <b>Host</b> text field.</p>
<p>Once a database server is running on the remote computer, its file system appears in the directory and file lists. The host name for each computer you access is added to the list of recently visited computers so that you may switch easily to computers you have recently accessed. If you installed VisIt with the provided network configurations then the list of recently visited computers also contains the hosts from the host profiles, which are covered later in this document.</p>
