<h2>Databases</h2>
<p>
A database specification looks similar to a database variable contained in angle brackets, but it is followed by a colon before the closing angle bracket, and it may also contain extra information. A database specification includes a file specification possibly followed a machine name, a time specification by itself, or a file/machine specification followed by a time specification. A file specification is just a file name with a path if needed. A machine specification is an at-sign @ followed by a host name. A time specification looks much like a list in that it contains integer numbers or ranges, or floating point numbers, separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets. However, it may also be followed by a letter c, t, or i to specify if the time specification refers to cycles, times, or indices, respectively. If no letter is specified, then the parser guesses that integers refer to cycles, floating point numbers refer to times. There is also an alternative to force indices which is the pound sign # after the opening square bracket.
