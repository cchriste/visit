<h2><p>Changing bounding-box mode</h2></p>
<p>The vis window allows a simple wireframe box to be substituted for complex plots when you want to rotate or move them. This is called bounding-box navigation and you can use it during navigate mode for complex plots so you can navigate faster when a vis window contains plots that take a long time to redraw. You can change the bounding-box mode by selecting the <b>Navigate bbox</b> option from the <b>Popup menu's</b> <b>Window</b> menu shown in Figure6-15. You can also change the bounding-box mode by clicking on the <b>Bounding-box icon</b> in the <b>Toolbar</b>.</p>
