<h2><p>Math operators</h2></p>
<p>These include use of +, -, *, /, ^ as addition, subtraction,  multiplication, division, and exponentiation as infix operators, as well as the unary minus, in their normal precedence and associativity.  Parentheses may be used as well to force a desired associativity.</p>
<p><i>Examples:  a+b^-c    (a+b)*c</p>
