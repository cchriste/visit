<h2>Setting the number of tensors</h2>
<p>
When visualizing a large database, a Tensor plot will often have too many tensors to effectively visualize so the Tensor plot provides controls to reduce the number of tensors to a number that looks appealing in a visualization. You can accomplish this reduction by setting a fixed number of tensors or by setting a stride. To set a fixed number of tensors, select the <b>N tensors</b> radio button and enter a new number of tensors into the <b>N tensors</b> text field. To reduce the number of tensors by setting the stride, select the <b>Stride</b> radio button and enter a new stride value into the <b>Stride</b> text field.
