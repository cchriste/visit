<h2>File extensions</h2>
<p>
VisIt uses file extensions to decide which database reader plugin should be used to open a particular file format. Each database reader plugin has a set of file extensions that are used to match a filename to it. When a file's extension matches (case sensitive except on MS Windows) that of a certain plugin, VisIt attempts to load the file with that plugin. If the plugin cannot load the file then VisIt attempts to open the file with the next suitable plugin, before trying to open the file with the default database reader plugin. If your files do not have file extensions then VisIt will attempt to use the default database reader plugin. You can provide the <i>-default_format</i> command line option with the name of the database reader plugin to use if you want to specify which reader VisIt should use when first trying to open a file. For example, if you want to load a PDB/Flash file, which usually has no file extension, you could provide: <i>-default_format PDB</i> on the command line.

GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats common in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) field. VisIt's GDAL reader can read the formats that GDAL itself can read including popular GIS formats such as: ArcInfo binary grid and Digital Elevation Map (DEM). For a complete list of the file formats that VisIt can access through the GDAL reader plugin, refer to http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html.Note that many of the formats that GDAL can read are actually image file formats. VisIt reads image file formats through its Image database reader plugin unless you tell the GDAL plugin to read image files by setting the VISIT_READ_IMAGES_WITH_GDAL environment variable.</td>

The Image database reader plugin can read in many popular image file formats, allowing you to plot images of experimental data or perform image analysis. In addition, the Image database reader plugin supports the creation of image volumes, which are comprised of a set of 2D slice images that can be reassembled into a 3D volume. An image volume file is a text file (ending in .imgvol) that contains the names of the images to be reassembled into a 3D volume.</td>
