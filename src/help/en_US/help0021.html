<h2><p>Virtual databases</h2></p>
<p>A virtual database is a time-varying database that VisIt artificially creates out of smaller, single time step databases that have related filenames. Virtual databases allow you to access time-varying data without having to first create a ".visit" file. The files that are grouped into a virtual database are determined by the file filter. That is, only files that match the file filter are considered for grouping into virtual databases. You can change the definition of a virtual database by changing the file filter before you add the virtual database into your selected files list. A virtual database appears in the file list and the selected files list as a set of filenames that are grouped under a single filename that contains the "*" wildcard character. When you click on any of the filenames in the virtual database, the entire database is selected.</p>
<p>You can tell VisIt to not automatically create virtual databases by selecting the <i>Off</i> option in the <b>File grouping </b>menu in the <b>File Selection Window</b>. When automatic file grouping is turned off, no files are grouped into virtual databases and groups of files that make up a time-varying database will not be recognized as such without a ".visit" file. See Figure2-2 for the effects of automatic file grouping on files in the <b>File Selection Window</b>.</p>
<p>VisIt has two levels of automatic file grouping. The default level is <i>Smart</i> file grouping, which enables automatic file grouping but has extra rules that prevent certain groups of files from being grouped into virtual databases. If you find that <i>Smart</i> file grouping does not provide the virtual databases that you expect, you can back the file grouping mode down to <i>On</i> or turn it off entirely.</p>
