<h2>Animation</h2>
<p>
Animation is used mainly for looking at how scientific databases evolve over time. Databases usually consist of many discrete time steps that contain the state of a simulation at a specific instant in time. Creating visualizations using just one time step from the database does not reveal time-varying behavior. To be most effective, visualizations must be created for all time steps in the database.
