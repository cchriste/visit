<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>

<!--
<p><b><font size="4">Announcements</font></b></p>
<ul>
   <li>The VisIt 1.12 release was made on an abbreviated schedule.  Our project decided to make this release early to 
       catch up to our regular release schedule, which had slipped with the 1.10 release.  We strive to have four major
       releases per year.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Announcements</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The VisIt team released a patch release, <a
    href="relnotes1.12.1.html">version 1.12.1</a>, to fix some critical
    defects that surfaced in the VisIt 1.12 release.  Descriptions of
    the defects addressed by the patch release can be found in the <a
    href="relnotes1.12.1.html">VisIt 1.12.1 release notes</a>.  All
    version 1.12.1 fixes are included in this release.</li>

<a name="General_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>You can now transform the time shown in the database information and time slider
      annotations. The new controls for time in the Annotations window allow you to
      scale time and add an offset.</li>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt's PDB reader now supports "streak plots". A streak plot is a 1D
      slice through an array that is stacked vertically and shown over time
      along the X axis. Streak plots reveal time-varying behavior present in
      the 1D slice as a 2D dataset. Streak plots are mainly for the investigation
      of "history data", which are various arrays stored to the PDB file by
      a simulation's user. Since history data are arbitrary and may not even
      be mesh data, VisIt does not know how to handle them in general. The PDB
      reader allows the user to provide a simple "schema" file that contains
      "streakplot" commands that inform the PDB reader how to slice and assemble
      various history data arrays into streak plot datasets that VisIt can
      visualize.
  </li>
  <li>VisIt's Pixie reader was fixed so moving meshes work properly.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Silo plugin was enhanced so it can preserve directory
      hierarchies for variables when exporting databases. This means that 
      variables that contain slashes "/" in the names will cause intermediate
      directories to be created, which is most often how those variables 
      acquired the "/" characters.</li>
  <li>VisIt can accept expression definitions from files that it opens.
      VisIt's Silo plugin was enhanced so it saves those expression definitions
      when exporting databases. This permits VisIt to transform an input
      database, export, and still retain the expression definitions from
      the original database.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Dyna3D reader has been enhanced so it is more tolerant of
      variable length material cards and malformed material cards.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Mili reader is now available for the windows platform.</li>
  <li>VisIt's STL reader has been fixed so it no longer crashes on MacOS X.</li>
  <li>VisIt's BOV reader has been enhanced so it supports short integer (16 bit) data. Use the <b>SHORT<b> keyword for the DATA_FORMAT in the BOV header file to specify that your BOV file contains short integer data.</li>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Other bugs fixed in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Various compilation issues were resolved for compiling VisIt on
      Linux-PPC systems.  Thanks to Patrick Shinpaugh for the fixes!</li>
  <li>When using the context menu in the plot list, copying a plot via the
      <i>Copy plot</i> menu option would result in no plots being selected.
      The default behavior has been modified so the new, copied plot is
      made active.</li>
  <li>The Fortran libsim interface could crash the simulation in the event that
      VisIt was unable to connect to the simulation.</li>
  <li>VisIt was not sending expression definitions to the compute engine
      prior to executing a database query. This could cause database queries 
      to fail if the expressions had not already been sent to the compute
      engine for another reason such as for creating a plot.</li>
  <li>VisIt's <i>Hohlraum Flux</i> query could crash the parallel compute engine if
      a processor did not have data.</li>
  <li>VisIt's <i>Hohlraum Flux</i> query could return all zeroes in the event that
      many of the line segments produced by its line scan were duplicates. This prevented
      the query from linking the line scans into larger connected lines along which
      the <i>Hohlraum Flux</i> query integrates its results.</li>
