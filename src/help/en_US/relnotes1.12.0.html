<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>

<!--
<p><b><font size="4">Announcements</font></b></p>
<ul>
   <li>The VisIt 1.12 release was made on an abbreviated schedule.  Our project decided to make this release early to 
       catch up to our regular release schedule, which had slipped with the 1.10 release.  We strive to have four major
       releases per year.</li>
</ul>

<!--
<p><b><font size="4">Announcements</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The VisIt team released a patch release, <a
    href="relnotes1.12.1.html">version 1.12.1</a>, to fix some critical
    defects that surfaced in the VisIt 1.12 release.  Descriptions of
    the defects addressed by the patch release can be found in the <a
    href="relnotes1.12.1.html">VisIt 1.12.1 release notes</a>.  All
    version 1.12.1 fixes are included in this release.</li>

<a name="General_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>You can now transform the time shown in the database information and time slider annotations. The new controls for time in the Annotations window allow you to scale time and add an offset.</li>
  <li>New expressions are available that compute hyperbolic sine, consine and tangent.<li>
  <li>You can now execute Ultra (curve plotting software) commands from within VisIt. This is accomplished from the CLI by using the new 'LoadUltra()' command, which will replace VisIt's command prompt with an Ultra prompt, allowing only Ultra commands to be entered. 'end' or 'quit' must be entered to return to VisIt's cli prompt.  Use 'help' at the Ultra prompt for information about currently supported commands.</li>
  <li>The Spreadsheet plot was enhanced so it is now possible to extract rows or columns of data and create Curve plots of the data vs. the X or Y mesh coordinates.  This allows plotting of curves from what is essentially a "logical lineout".</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<a name="Advanced_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced features added in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt can now connect to simulations using SSH tunneling.</li>

</ul>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt's PDB reader now supports "streak plots". A streak plot is a 1D
      slice through an array that is stacked vertically and shown over time
      along the X axis. Streak plots reveal time-varying behavior present in
      the 1D slice as a 2D dataset. Streak plots are mainly for the investigation
      of "history data", which are various arrays stored to the PDB file by
      a simulation's user. Since history data are arbitrary and may not even
      be mesh data, VisIt does not know how to handle them in general. The PDB
      reader allows the user to provide a simple "schema" file that contains
      "streakplot" commands that inform the PDB reader how to slice and assemble
      various history data arrays into streak plot datasets that VisIt can
      visualize.
  </li>
  <li>VisIt's Pixie reader was fixed so moving meshes work properly.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Silo plugin was enhanced so it can preserve directory
      hierarchies for variables when exporting databases. This means that 
      variables that contain slashes "/" in the names will cause intermediate
      directories to be created, which is most often how those variables 
      acquired the "/" characters.</li>
  <li>VisIt can accept expression definitions from files that it opens.
      VisIt's Silo plugin was enhanced so it saves those expression definitions
      when exporting databases. This permits VisIt to transform an input
      database, export, and still retain the expression definitions from
      the original database.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Dyna3D reader has been enhanced so it is more tolerant of
      variable length material cards and malformed material cards.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Mili reader is now available for the windows platform.</li>
  <li>VisIt's STL reader has been fixed so it no longer crashes on MacOS X.</li>
  <li>VisIt's BOV reader has been enhanced so it supports short integer (16 bit) 
      data. Use the <b>SHORT</b> keyword for the DATA_FORMAT in the BOV header file
      to specify that your BOV file contains short integer data.</li>
  <li>The accepted maximum line length in VisIt's PlainText reader has been
      increased from 4K to 32K characters.</li>
  <li>Added database readers for paraDIS data, and for paraDIS-style tecplot data.  </li>
  <li>VisIt's PDB reader supports another convention.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Silo writer has been enhanced to properly save out ghost zones for
      unstructured meshes as ghost instead of as real zones. This ensures they 
      will be handled correctly when the Silo dataset is read back into VisIt.</li>
  <li>VisIt's VTK reader has been enhanced so it exposes array variables for arrays
      contain many components. If those arrays contain character or unsigned character
      data then VisIt exposes them as label variables.</li>
  <li>VisIt's PATRAN reader now serves up cell-centered variables defined with
      card 4 as scalars that can be plotted. For lack of a better method of
      naming them, they are called: property1, property2, and so on.</li>
  <li>VisIt's MFIX reader was fixed to support multiple time states.</li>

<a name="Operator_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's operators in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed the Box operator to work correctly with curves.</li>
  <li>The Revolve operator was fixed so it can once more revolve about a user-defined axis of revolution.</li>
  <li>Fixed Lineout operator's no-sampling mode to enable handling of very small-scale data </li>

<a name="Expression_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's expression language in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added hyperbolic versions of sine, cosine and tangent: sinh, cosh, tanh</li>
  <li>Added optional numeric argument for ln and log10 expressions. The value specified will be used in liu of taking ln/log10 of non-positive values and will prevent VisIt from throwing exceptions when non-positive values are encountered.</li>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Other bugs fixed in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Various compilation issues were resolved for compiling VisIt on
      Linux-PPC systems.  Thanks to Patrick Shinpaugh for the fixes!</li>
  <li>When using the context menu in the plot list, copying a plot via the
      <i>Copy plot</i> menu option would result in no plots being selected.
      The default behavior has been modified so the new, copied plot is
      made active.</li>
  <li>The Fortran libsim interface could crash the simulation in the event that
      VisIt was unable to connect to the simulation.</li>
  <li>VisIt was not sending expression definitions to the compute engine
      prior to executing a database query. This could cause database queries 
      to fail if the expressions had not already been sent to the compute
      engine for another reason such as for creating a plot.</li>
  <li>VisIt's <i>Hohlraum Flux</i> query could crash the parallel compute engine if
      a processor did not have data.</li>
  <li>VisIt's <i>Hohlraum Flux</i> query could return all zeroes in the event that
      many of the line segments produced by its line scan were duplicates. This prevented
      the query from linking the line scans into larger connected lines along which
      the <i>Hohlraum Flux</i> query integrates its results.</li>
  <li>VisIt's simulation database reader was not freeing unstructured data.</li>
  <li>VisIt's component launcher program was fixed so users can use "Parse from SSH_CLIENT" in their host profiles when connecting to libsim-instrumented simulations that run on remote computers. That setting would previously cause simulations to crash when VisIt connected to them.</li>
  <li>Fixed log-view scaling so that it works correctly with 2d Contour plots.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Spreadsheet plot now highlights the correct cell for node picks.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>xml2projectfile is now built by default</li>
  <li>VisIt's configure script now provides an --enable-engine-only option that lets you
      build just the compute engine and its plugins. This option is useful when you need to 
      build just a compute engine for a remote server.</li>
  <li>VisIt's configure script now provides an --enable-server-components-only option that
      lets you build only the compute engine, mdserver, vcl, and their plugins.</li>
  <li>VisIt's compute engine was ported to BlueGene/P.</li>
