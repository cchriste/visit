<h2>Choosing the movie name</h2>
<p>
Once you have specified options that tell VisIt what kinds of movies that you want to make, you must provide the base name and location for your movies. By default, movies are saved to the directory in which you started VisIt. If you want to specify an alternate directory, you can either type in a new directory path into the <b>Output directory</b> text field (see Figure figure) or you can select a directory from the <b>Choose directory</b> dialog box activated by clicking on the <i>"..."</i> button.

When generating multiple movies with differing resolutions, the movie resolution is often encoded into the filename. VisIt may generate many different movies with different names but they will all share the same base filename that you provided by typing into the <b>Base filename</b> text field.
