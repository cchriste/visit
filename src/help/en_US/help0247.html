<h2><p>Choosing the movie name</h2></p>
<p>Once you have specified options that tell VisIt what kinds of movies that you want to make, you must provide the base name and location for your movies. By default, movies are saved to the directory in which you started VisIt. If you want to specify an alternate directory, you can either type in a new directory path into the <b>Output directory</b> text field (see Figure5-6) or you can select a directory from the <b>Choose directory</b> dialog box activated by clicking on the <b>"..."</b> button.</p>
<p>The base filename for the movie is the name that is prepended to all of the movies that you generate. When generating multiple movies with differing resolutions, the movie resolution is often encoded into the filename. VisIt may generate many different movies with different names but they will all share the same base filename that you provided by typing into the <b>Base filename</b> text field.</p>
