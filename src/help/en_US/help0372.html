<h2><p>Setting the number of lineout samples</h2></p>
<p>The Lineout operator works by extracting sample points along a line. The sample points are then used to create Curve plots. The Lineout operator's default sampling scheme is to sample data values at the intersections between the sampling line and the cell boundaries encountered along the way. This method gives rise to jagged Curve plots favored by many VisIt users. See Figure8-15 for a comparison between the sampling methods. If you instead want to smoothly sample the cells along the sampling line with some number of evenly spaced sample points, you can make the Lineout operator use evenly spaced sampling by clicking on the <b>Override Global Lineout Settings</b> check box in the <b>Lineout operator attributes window</b>. Once you've told the Lineout operator to override the global lineout settings click on the <b>Use Sampling</b> check box and enter a number of sample points. The number of sample points taken along the line determine the fidelity of the Curve plot. Generally, it is best to set the number of sample points such that each cell is sampled at least once. To set the number of sample points, type a new number into the <b>Samples</b> text field in the <b>Lineout operator attributes window</b>.</p>
