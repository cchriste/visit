<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.3.4 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.3.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>VisIt's automatic file grouping has been extended so that instead of being on or off, there are now three modes: on, off, and smart. The new smart file grouping mode performs the same as regular file grouping except that ALE3D files ending in .1, .2, .3, etc are not grouped into their own virtual databases. The file grouping mode is still set using controls in the File selection window. If you encounter errors using smart file grouping, you can revert back to regular file grouping or turn off file grouping.</li>
<li>VisIt no longer has to regenerate a plot when adding time states to a database when refreshing the file list. Note that reopening a database will still force plots to be regenerated.</li>
<li>Lineouts no longer sample data by default. The new behavior extracts the cell data along the line. The sampling behavior is still available in the Lineout operator attributes window.</li>
<li>VisIt's Silo database reader plugin now supports databases that were written using Silo's HDF5 file writing mode.</li>
<li>VisIt can now read OVERFLOW files, which are generated by a NASA CFD code.</li>
<li>VisIt can now save tiled images that include the images from all of the vis windows that have plots.</li>
<li>VisIt's Box tool has been changed so it has hotpoints at the center of each face of the box so it is easier to change the shape of the box in any axis-aligned direction.</li>
<li>It is now much easier to make a movie using a parallel compute engine using "visit -movie". Information about the compute engine used in the session is now stored in the session file and "visit -movie" uses it to launch a similarly configured engine for making the movie.</li>
<li>VisIt's 2D and 3D axes now show the axis titles that were stored in the database.</li>
<li>VisIt now displays variable units in the legend if the units are known.</li>
<li>You can now specify a directory where image files will be saved using the controls in the Set save options window. The Windows version of VisIt will now, by default, save images to the <i>My images</i> directory in the directory where VisIt was installed.</li>
<li>The Subset window has been enhanced so it allows you to select multiple sets using the mouse and apply an action to all of the selected sets. The window still retains the ability to perform actions on all sets in a collection.</li>
<li>Variable lists from Boxlib files are no longer sorted before they are inserted into the variable menus.</li>
<li>VisIt now accurately reports the filenames for SILs that are served up from the Exodus database reader plugin.</li>
<li>VisIt's PF3D reader has been rewritten so it will work for new style PF3D files.</li>
<li>VisIt's CLI now ignores window sizes that are stored in session files so the -geometry command line argument will always take effect for sizing images.</li>
<li>Changing time states with Mili databases is now much faster since VisIt is smarter about when it needs to read in connectivity arrays.</li>
<li>VisIt now issues a warning message when you attempt to read in an old session file.</li>
<li>VisIt's KullLite database reader plugin can now read in face lists and node lists.</li>
<li>VisIt's KullLite database reader plugin can now read in 2D databases.</li>
<li>VisIt's File panel always adds a root node when a database with multiple time states is in the selected file list so those databases can be collapsed.</li>
<li>The 'enter' key now works in the File selection window for navigating directories and file selection.</li>
<li>You can now set a preference that will prevent VisIt from prompting you about whether you want to apply an operator to plots that have no operators. You can set the preference in the Preferences window.</li>
<li>VisIt's File panel now displays a horizontal scrollbar if any of the files in the list have long names.</li>
<li>The exponentiation notation for the axis labels has been improved.</li>
<li>You no longer have to specify the entire path when you use the -sessionfile argument with VisIt's GUI.</li>
<li>The Set save options window now has a Save button that applies the settings and saves the active vis window.</li>
<li>VisIt uses the new &lt;iostream&gt; instead of &lt;iostream.h&gt; to improve portability among newer compilers.</li>
<li>The Window source distribution now provides project files for Microsoft Visual Studio 7 .NET 2003. The Windows version of VisIt is now built with the .NET compiler by default, though it can still be built with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.</li>
<li>The Volume plot's hardware accelerated 3D texturing-based renderer is now available on the Windows platform.</li>
</ul>
