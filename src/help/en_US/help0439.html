<h2>Locking views</h2>
<p>
When using more than one visualization window, such as when comparing plots using two different databases side by side, it is often useful for the plots being compared to have the same view. VisIt allows you to lock the views together for the two visualization windows so that when you change the rotate, zoom, etc on plots in any window whose view is locked, all other windows with locked views get the new view. To lock the view for a visualization window, click the <b>Locked view</b> check box in the <b>View Window's Advanced tab</b> or click on the Toolbar button to lock views.
