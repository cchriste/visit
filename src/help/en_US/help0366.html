<h2><p>Dynamic lineout</h2></p>
<p>Normally when you perform a lineout operation, the Curve plot that results from the lineout operation is in no way connected to the plots in the window that originated the Curve plot. If you want to make variable or time state changes made to the originating plots also affect the Curve plots that were created via lineout, you should set the dynamic lineout flag for lineouts in the <b>Lineout Options Window</b> (see Figure8-11). To open the <b>Lineout Options Window</b> (not the <b>Lineout operator attributes</b> window), select <b>Lineout</b> from the <b>Controls</b> menu in the <b>Main Window</b>. Click the <b>Dynamic</b> check box in the <b>Lineout Options Window</b> to make new Curve plots, created via lineout, be linked to their originating plots so they will be affected by variable or time state changes made to the originating plots.</p>
<p>The <b>Lineout Options Window</b> also contains some other options affecting dynamic lineouts. When you change the variable in the plot the originated the lineout, the lineout will change. When you change time states for the plot that originated the lineout, the lineout will change. However, you can instead make VisIt create a new Curve plot for the lineout each time the you change the originating plot's time state by changing the Time change behavior in the <b>Lineout Options Window</b> from <b>updates curve</b> to <b>creates new curve</b>. When VisIt creates a new curve each time you advance to a new time state, VisIt will put a new curve in the lineout destination window, resulting in many Curve plots (see Figure8-12). By default, VisIt will make all of the related Curve plots be the same color. You can override this behavior by selecting <b>creates new color</b> instead of <b>repeats color</b> from the <b>Lineout Options Window's New Curve</b> combo box.</p>
