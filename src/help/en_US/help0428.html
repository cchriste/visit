<h2><p>Shadows</h2></p>
<p>VisIt supports shadows when scalable rendering is being used. Shadows can be useful for increasing the realism of your visualization. The controls to turn on shadows can be found in the <b>Rendering Options Window</b>. To turn on shadows, you must currently turn on scalable rendering by clicking on the <b>Always</b> radio button under the <b>Use scalable rendering</b> label. Once scalable rendering has been turned on, the Shadows controls become enabled. The default shadow strength is 50%. If you desire a stronger or weaker shadow, adjust the <b>Strength</b> slider until you are satisfied with the amount of shadow that appears in the visualization. The same plot is shown with and without shadows in Figure9-28.</p>
