<h2>Making a stereo movie</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure6"></a><img src="../images/SavingPrinting/savemoviewizard3.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 6</i></td></tr></table></center><br>The <b>Save movie wizard</b> allows you to create stereo movies if you choose the <b>Yes</b> button on the wizard's third screen. The default is to create regular, non-stereo movies because stereo movies are not widely supported. The only movie format that VisIt produces that is compatible with stereo movies is the "Streaming movie" format, which is an LLNL format commonly used for tiled displays. The "Streaming movie" format can support stereo movies where the image will flicker between left and right eye versions of the movie, causing a stereo effect if you view the movie using suitable liquid-crystal goggles. The stereo option has no effect when used with other movie formats. However, if you choose to save a stereo movie in any of VisIt's supported image formats, VisIt will save images for the left eye and images for the right eye. You can then take the left and right images into your favorite stereo movie creation software to create your own stereo movie.
