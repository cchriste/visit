<h2><p>General Annotations</h2></p>
<p>VisIt has a few general annotations that describe the visualization and are independent of the type of database in the visualization. General annotations encompass user name, database name, and plot legends. The <b>Annotation Window</b> does not provide too much flexibility for these types of annotations, but it does provide controls that allow you to disable these annotations. Figure9-2 shows common locations for some general annotations.</p>
