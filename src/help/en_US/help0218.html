<h2><p>Positioning and resizing the slice sphere</h2></p>
<p>You can position the slice sphere by setting its origin in the <b>SphereSlice operator attributes window</b> shown in Figure4-53. The slice sphere is specified by a center point and a radius. To change the slice sphere's center, enter a new point into the <b>Origin</b> text field. The origin is a 3D coordinate that is represented by three space-separated floating point numbers. To resize the sphere, enter a new radius number into the <b>Radius</b> text field.</p>
