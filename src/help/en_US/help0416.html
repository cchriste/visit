<h2>Converting color table types</h2>
<p>
It is possible to convert a continuous color table to a discrete color table and vice-versa using the <b>Continuous</b> and <b>Discrete</b> radio buttons in the editor portion of the <b>Color table window</b>. Changing the color table type from discrete to continuous does not change the color table's color control points; it only changes how they are used. If you select the levels color table and click the <b>Continuous</b> radio button, the color table will be changed into a continuous color table and the <b>Editor area</b> will change to continuous mode and show the color table in a spectrum but no color control points will have changed. You can even turn the color table back into a discrete color table and the <b>Editor area</b> will show the color table in discrete mode, but the color control points will not have changed.
