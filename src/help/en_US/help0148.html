<h2>Operators</h2>
<p>
An operator is a filter applied to a database variable before the compute engine uses that variable to generate a plot. VisIt provides several standard operator types that allow various operations to be performed on plot data. The standard operators perform data restriction operations like planar slicing, spherical slicing, and thresholding, as well as more sophisticated operations like peeling off mesh layers. All of VisIt's operators are plugins and you can write your own operator plugins to extend VisIt in new ways. See the wiki at www.visitusers.org for more details on creating new operator plugins or send an e-mail inquiry to visit-users@elist.ornl.gov.
