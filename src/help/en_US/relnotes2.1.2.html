<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 2.1.2 is primarily a
bug fix release to release 2.1.1. It fixes additional bugs in release
2.1.1.  Look <a href="relnotes2.1.1.html">here</a> to see a complete
list of changes in release 2.1.1.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.1.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>A bug was fixed that caused VisIt to crash if the
<tt>GetTimeSliderNStates</tt> python function was called when there was
no active time slider.</li>
<li>A bug was corrected that caused a parallel compute engine started with msub or qsub to silently fail when the user started VisIt in a directory that they didn't have write permission in.</li>
<li>A bug was corrected in the Point3D database reader that caused the last point to be ignored.</li>
<li>The Simulation window has been fixed so it no longer loses its command buttons.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced in 2.1.1 on Windows which prevented VisIt from connecting to remote machines.</li>
<li>A memory leak in the viewer caused by repeated menu creation has been fixed.</li>
<li>Plot variable menus were being created far too often due to some changes that broke variable list caching. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>VisIt was interpreting all double-precision Z-coordinates from simulations as zero, causing "flat plots".</li>
<li>build_visit was patched to work with old versions of gcc when building Mesa</li>
<li>build_visit now correctly builds optimized libraries and executables with 64 bit Linux machines.</li>
<li>A bug was corrected that caused VisIt's save movie routines to save out files with names that contained only the file extension.</li>
<li>A bug was corrected with the Exodus reader for setting up element blocks with non-consecutive numbers.</li>
<li>A bug was corrected where data-level comparisons on vector data would return the value of the first vector component for all three components,
when using the "pos_cmfe" option, running in parallel, and working on rectilinear grids.</li>
<li>Plugin development tools now work against an installed verison of VisIt on Windows.</li>
</ul>
