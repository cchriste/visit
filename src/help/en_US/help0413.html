<h2>Exporting a color table</h2>
<p>
If you design a color table that you want to share with colleagues, click the <b>Export</b> button in the <b>Manager area</b> to save an XML file containing color table definition for the highlighted color table to your .visit directory. The name of a color table file will usually be composed of the name of the color table with a <i>".ct"</i> extension. Copying a color table file to a user's .visit directory will allow VisIt to find the color table the next time VisIt runs. Look for the color table file in the directory in which VisIt was installed if you use the Windows version of VisIt.
