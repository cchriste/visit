<h2>Browsing subsets</h2>
<p>
To browse the subsets for a database, you must first have created a plot. Once a plot is created and selected, open the <b>Subset Window</b>. The left panel in the <b>Subset Window</b> contains the database's top level set and may also list some subset categories. Some simple databases lack subset categories thus VisIt cannot create subsets. To start browsing the available subsets, click on one of the subset categories to display the subsets of that category. For instance, clicking on a "Material" subset category will list all of the database's materials in the next panel to the right. The materials are subsets of the top level set and decompose the top level set based on material. Double clicking on a set or clicking on a green turndown arrow lists any subset categories that can be used to further break down the set.
