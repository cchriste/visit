<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 2.2.1 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 2.2.1 is primarily a
bug fix release to release 2.2.1. It fixes additional bugs in release
2.2.1.  Look <a href="relnotes2.2.1.html">here</a> to see a complete
list of changes in release 2.2.1.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.2.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>VisIt's simV2 simulation instrumentation library was fixed so operations that require synchronization with the viewer, such as <i>VisItUpdatePlots()</i>, do not lock up in parallel when a simulation's slave callback function does not broadcast integers.</li>
<li>The xmlinfo tool now generates the correct plugin info for operator plugins that create expressions from vectors or tensors.</li>
<li>The xmledit tool now correctly greys out the operator section for plot and database plugins.</li>
<li>File format readers that produce point meshes with degenerate connectivity are now better supported; Pseudocolor plots now get the correct range for these files.</li>
<li>Fixed problem with using Pick after animating through time.</li>
<li>The ray-casted volume renderer now properly honors non-white light sources.</li>
<li>When doing a ray-casted volume rendering, changes to the <i>Smoothing</i> button now correctly take effect in the lighting model.</li>
<li>LibSim is now installed on Windows.</li>
<li>Queries over time will no longer cause the engine to exit when invalid start and end times are requested.</li>
<li>The DualMesh operator now correctly works with 2D meshes that are not at Z=0 as well.</li>
<li>3D axis labels now show adequate precision when autoscaled.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.2.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>VisIt will now use the internal platform name <i>darwin-x86_64</i> on MacOS X 10.6 and later. This allows the older MacOS X 10.5 <i>darwin-i386</i> version to be installed side by side with the newer 64-bit version in directories that contain multiple VisIt installations for different platforms.</li>
<li>Event handling has been rewritten in VisIt's Java client so it no longer requires a second thread. Synchronization with a 2 thread design proved to be too error prone and evidently did not work on all Java virtual machines.</li>
</ul>
