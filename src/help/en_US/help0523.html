<h2>Setting the partition/pool</h2>
<p>
Some parallel computers are divided into partitions so that batch processes might be executed on one part of the computer while interactive processes are executed on another part of the computer. You can use host profiles tell VisIt which partition to use when launching the compute engine on systems that have multiple partitions. To set the partition, check the <b>Partition/Pool</b> check box and type a partition name into the <b>Partition/Pool</b> text field.
