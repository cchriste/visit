<h2><p>The Save Window</h2></p>
<p>You can open the <b>Save Window</b> by selecting <b>Set save options</b> from the <b>Main Window's File menu</b>. The <b>Save Window</b> contains the controls that allow you to set the options that govern how visualizations are saved. </p>
<p>The <b>Save Window</b>, shown in Figure5-1, contains three basic groups of controls. The first group allows you to set the file information. Use the file information controls to set the name and destination of the saved file, as well as its file type and any optional quality parameters that may exist for the selected file type. Use the second group of controls when saving out an image file to specify the dimensions of the saved image. Finally, a group of check boxes near the bottom of the window control miscellaneous file saving features. When the save options are set and applied by clicking the <b>Apply</b> button, the active visualization can be saved either through the <b>Save Window</b> option in the <b>Main Window's File menu</b>, by the keyboard shortcut <i>Ctrl+S</i>, or by clicking the <b>Save</b> button in the <b>Save window</b>.</p>
