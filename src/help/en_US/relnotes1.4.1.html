<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.4.1 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.4.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>VisIt now has a Scatter plot, which allows you to visualize multivariate data as a point mesh. The new plot allows you to use up to 4 input variables. Up to three of the input variables can be used for coordinates and one of the input variables can be used for colors. Each of the dimensions can be scaled independently or they can all be mapped into a unit cube. The Scatter plot provides a plot wizard to help you initialize the many input variables to the plot so it is easier to create and use the plot.</li>
<li>VisIt can now read files written in the ASCII form of the TecPlot file format.</li>
<li>Zooming in on 2D datasets now increases the size of the viewport, making it more square, until the zoomed rectangle takes up most of the vis window. This allows you to see more of the dataset as you zoom using the middle mouse button.</li>
<li>VisIt's Volume plot now has a 3rd rendering mode that lets you do raycasting volume-rendering. The new raycasting volume-renderer even accepts geometry from other plots allowing you to show both surfaces and volume-rendered data.</li>
<li>VisIt's Expressions window now has a new <i>Insert variables</i> button that lets you choose to insert variables from a list of available variables and expressions.</li>
<li>VisIt's Pick window now has a <i>Variables</i> button that lets you select secondary variables from a list of variables for the current plot. There are also two new checkboxes that let you choose whether or not to display the reference pick letter in the picked plot, and whether or not the returned node/zone ids should be the global values as read from the file.</li>
<li>Many of VisIt's plot and operator attributes windows that used a line edit control for entering a variable name have been improved so they use a variable menu. The variable menu allows you to select a variable from a list of variables for the active plot or the active source.</li>
<li>VisIt's Streamline plot has been enhanced so it can integrate more smoothly and can create longer streamlines. The plot also can now color by vorticity magnitude in addition to coloring by speed and the plot can now be displayed using lines, tubes, or ribbons. Finally, the Streamline plot now works with VisIt's Point tool when you use the plot with a point streamline source.</li>
<li>VisIt's Vector plot has been enhanced by adding <i>Scale by magnitude</i> and <i>Auto scale</i> options. When <i>Scale by magnitude</i> is on, the size of the vectors depends on the magnitude of the vector. When <i>Scale by magnitude</i> is off, the vectors are all the same size. The default is on, which matches the previous behavior. When <i>Auto scale</i> is on, the size of the vectors is choosen so that they are a reasonable size. When <i>Auto scale</i> is off, the size of the vector is determined by the <i>Scale</i>. The default is on, which is different than the previous behavior.</li>
<li>VisIt's Tensor plot has been enhanced by adding <i>Scale by magnitude</i> and <i>Auto scale</i> options. When <i>Scale by magnitude</i> is on, the size of the tensors depends on the magnitude of the tensor. When <i>Scale by magnitude</i> is off, the tensors are all the same size. The default is on, which matches the previous behavior. When <i>Auto scale</i> is on, the size of the tensors is choosen so that they are a reasonable size. When <i>Auto scale</i> is off, the size of the tensor is determined by the <i>Scale</i>. The default is on, which is different than the previous behavior.</li>
<li>VisIt's 3D navigation mode now has a <i>Dolly</i> interaction mode that lets you move the camera toward the object. To enable <i>Dolly</i> mode, bring up the <i>Interactors</i> window and change the <i>Navigation mode</i> to <i>Dolly</i>. When in <i>Dolly</i> mode, the rotation interaction causes the view to rotate about the center of the object, the zoom interaction causes the camera to move toward the focus, and the pan interaction causes the camera and focus to move parallel to the image.</li>
<li>VisIt's 3D navigation mode now has a <i>Flythrough</i> interaction mode that lets you move the camera through the dataset for genuine fly-throughs. To enable <i>Flythrough</i> mode, bring up the <i>Interactors</i> window and change the <i>Navigation mode</i> to <i>Flythrough</i>. When in <i>Flythrough</i> mode, the rotation interaction causes the view to rotate about the camera, the zoom interaction causes the camera and focus to move forward, and the pan interaction causes the camera and focus to move parallel to the image.</li>
<li>Point mesh rendering has been improved so that it is much faster.</li>
<li>VisIt can now read mixed variables from Flash files.</li>
<li>VisIt now supports data from the CMAT file format.</li>
<li>Changing the point size on a Mesh plot no longer causes a recalculation.</li>
<li>Replacing a file now works harder to preserve the old SIL selection, if possible.</li>
<li>The Replace button in VisIt's Main window is no longer grayed out when it should remain active.</li>
<li>Opening Silo files is somewhat faster.</li>
<li>VisIt's <i>Save options</i> window works better when clicking the <i>Save</i> button.</li>
<li>VisIt now has the ability to pick on point meshes that have had glyphs applied.</li>
<li>VisIt's Revolve operator is now built by default.</li>
<li>Planes in the Clip operator attributes window are now grayed out if they are turned off.</li>
<li>VisIt's <i>visit -movie</i> script can now save PNG image files.</li>
<li>The Volume plot's opacities are now scaled so as to highlight high opacities and reduce the contribution of lower opacities.</li>
<li>VisIt can now be built with xlC on AIX platforms.</li>
<li>You can now run many of VisIt's tools using their name on the command line instead of typing: <i>visit -command</i></li>
<li>VisIt now provides version-specific VisIt scripts, which allow for better error checking and prevent the mixing of public and private versions.</li>
<li>VisIt now allows for specifying a global node/zone id for the OnionPeel operator and the PickByZone, PickByNode, Zone Center and Node Coords queries. This option is accessed in the GUI by toggling the new checkbox in the Queries and OnionPeel windows.. In the CLI, the OnionPeel option is accessed via setting OnionPeelAttributes. For Pick: PickByGlobalZone(gzoneno), PickByGlobalNode(gnodeno). For Query: Query("Global Zone Center", gzoneid) and Query("Global Node Coords", gnodeid).</li>
<li>VisIt can now generate curl, divergence, and the Laplacian through its expression language.</li>
<li>VisIt now supports the Enzo file format for AMR grids.</li>
