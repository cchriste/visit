<h2>Replacing a database</h2>
<p>
If you have created a plot with one database and want to see what it looks like using data from another database, you can replace the database using the <b>File panel's</b> <b>Replace</b> button. To replace a database, first select a new database by clicking on a file in the <b>File panel's Selected files list</b> and then click the <b>Replace</b> button. This will make VisIt try to replace the databases used in the plots with the new database. If the replace operation is a success, the plots are regenerated using the new database and they are displayed in the visualization window.
