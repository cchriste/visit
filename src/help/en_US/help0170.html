<h2><p>Decimate operator</h2></p>
<p>The Decimate operator, shown in Figure4-18, removes nodes and cells from an input mesh, reducing the cell count while trying to maintain the overall shape of the original mesh. The Decimate operator can currently operate only on the external surfaces of the input geometry. This means that in order to apply the Decimate operator, you must first apply the ExternalSurfaces operator, which will be covered later in this chapter.</p>
