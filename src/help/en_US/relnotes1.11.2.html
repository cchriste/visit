<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 1.11.2 is primarily a bug fix release to release 1.11.  It fixes additional bugs in release 1.11. Look <a href="relnotes1.11.0.html">here</a> to see a complete list of bugs fixed in release 1.11.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 1.11.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for ANNOTATION_INT nodelists in Silo plugin.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.11.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The file depcomp was added to the binary distributions so that plugins could be built against the binary distributions.</li>
<li>Fixed speed issues seen on a Silo file, using the HDF driver, with lots of domains and the standard (non-packed, directory-based) structured connectivity info</li>
<li>Fixed problem with revolved surface area query returning 0 on a mesh of beam elements. Note, it is important for the database to indicate that topological dimension of the mesh is 1. For a Silo database, one would use the DBOPT_TOPO_DIM option to the DBPutUcdmesh() call.</li>
<li>Added support for VTK meshes which contain non-zero count of points but zero count of cells. The transform manager will now add VTK_VERTEX cells to such datasets.</li>
<li>A memory leak was fixed with ray-casted volume rendering.</li>
<li>Fixed problem with build_visit failing to install Silo on Darwin because it was using a C compiler to link code with C++ dependencies.</li>
<li>Host profiles were added for Princeton clusters.</li>
</ul>
