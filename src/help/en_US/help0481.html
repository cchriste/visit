<h2>Activating a database</h2>
<p>
VisIt can have any number of databases open simultaneously but there is still an active database that is used to create new plots. Each time you open a database, the newly opened database becomes the active database and consequently the source database for any new plots that you decide to create. If you want to create a plot using a database that is open but is not your active database, you must activate that database so it becomes your active database. When you activate a database, its variables are added to the menus for the various plot types.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways to activate a database and the method that you choose depends on how you have configured the <b>File panel</b> to display files. By default, the <b>File panel</b> shows the <b>Selected files</b> list and the <b>Open</b>, <b>ReOpen</b>, <b>Activate</b>, <b>Replace</b>, and <b>Overlay</b> buttons. However, you can configure the <b>File panel</b> so it does not show the <b>Selected files</b> list. You can read more about configuring the <b>File panel</b> in the Preferences chapter of this book. If the <b>Selected files</b> list is shown in the <b>File panel</b>, you can click on a database in the <b>Selected files</b> list that you've previously opened and click the <b>Activate</b> button to set the active database to the highlighted file. The <b>Activate</b> button, shown in Figure figure, is located in the same place as the <b>Open</b> or <b>ReOpen</b> buttons but it is only displayed if you have clicked on a file that you have previously opened that is not already the active database.

The second method for activating a database is to select a database from the <b>Source</b> combo box, which is located just above the plot list and contains the list of opened databases (see figure).
