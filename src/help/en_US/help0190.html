<h2>Setting the isosurfacing variable</h2>
<p>
The Isosurface operator database variable can differ from the plotted variable. This enables plots to combine information from two variables by having isosurfaces of one variable and then coloring the resulting surfaces by another variable. You can change the isosurfacing variable, by selecting a new variable name from the <b>Variable</b> variable button.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it is useful to set the isosurfacing variable when the plotted variable is not a scalar. For example, you might want to apply the Isosurface operator to a Mesh plot but the Mesh plot's plotted variable is not a scalar so the Isosurface operator does not know what to do. To avoid this situation, you can set the isosurfacing variable to one you know to be scalar and the operator will succeed.
