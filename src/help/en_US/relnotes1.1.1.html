<p align="center"><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.1.1 Release Notes</font></b></p>
<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important 
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.1.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The views toolbar has a new icon that lets you save your current view and use it again later so that you can easily save several views and choose between them.</li>
  <li>The Color Table Window now allows you to change the size of discrete color tables, such as the color table used with the Subset plot, so that they can contain as many colors as you want up to 200 colors.</li>
  <li>VisIt's CLI can now be run without a display when the -nowin option is provided.</li>
  <li>VisIt's compute engine now loads its plot, operator, and database plugins on demand so it starts up twice as fast on average.</li>
  <li>The Subset window now has "turndowns" so that it is easier to expand subsets.</li>
  <li>The window toolbar now has a clear window icon.</li>
  <li>The Main Window's file panel has been modified so that when you click on a file that you have opened before, that file becomes the active file. This means that to re-open a file, you have to click on the ReOpen button.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.1.1</font></b></p>

  <li>VisIt's viewer no longer prints out a warning message when launching a metadata server on a machine where it has not yet been launched.</li>
