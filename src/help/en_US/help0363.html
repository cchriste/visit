<h2>Picking over time</h2>
<p>
Querying over time is normally done using the controls in the <b>Query Window</b> but you can also pick over time to generate curves that show the behavior of a picked zone or node over time. To pick over time, you must click the <b>Create time curve with next pick</b> check box in the <b>Pick Window</b>. Once that check box is turned on, each pick operation will result in a new Curve plot that shows the behavior of the most recently picked zone or node over time.
