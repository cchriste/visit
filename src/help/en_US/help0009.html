<h2><p>Applying settings</h2></p>
<p>When using one of VisIt's control windows, you must click the <b>Apply</b> button for the new settings to take effect. All control windows have an <b>Apply</b> button in the lower left corner of the window. By default, new settings are not applied until the <b>Apply</b> button is clicked because it is more efficient to make several changes and then apply them at once. VisIt has a mode called <i>auto update</i> that makes all changes in settings take place immediately. Auto update is not enabled by default because it can cause plots to be regenerated each time settings change and for the database sizes for which VisIt is designed, autoupdate may not always make sense. If you prefer to have new settings apply immediately, you can enable auto update by clicking on the <b>Auto update</b> check box in the middle of the <b>Main Window</b>. If auto update is enabled, you do not have to click the <b>Apply</b> button to apply changes.</p>
