<h2><p>Lineout mode</h2></p>
<p>You can put the visualization window into lineout mode by selecting <b>Lineout</b> from the <b>Popup menu's</b> <b>Mode</b> submenu. Note that lineout mode is only available with 2D plots in this version though you can create 3D lineouts using the Lineout query in the <b>Query Window</b>. After the visualization window is in lineout mode, you can draw reference lines in the window. Each reference line causes VisIt to extract data from the database along the prescribed path and draw the data as a Curve plot in another visualization window. Each reference line is drawn in a color that matches the initial color of the Curve plot so the reference lines, which have no labels, can be easily associated with their corresponding Curve plots. If lineout's dynamic mode is also set then changes such as a variable or time state change made to the plot that originated a Curve plot via a lineout operation are also reflected in the Curve plot. To clear the reference lines from the visualization window, select the <b>Reference lines</b> option <b>Clear</b> submenu in the <b>Main Window's Window</b> menu. An example of the visualization window with reference lines and Curve plots is shown in Figure8-10.</p>
