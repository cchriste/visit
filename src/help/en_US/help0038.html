<h2>Plots</h2>
<p>
A plot is a viewable object, created from a database, that can be displayed in a visualization window. VisIt provides several standard plot types that allow you to visualize data in different ways. The standard plots perform basic visualization operations like contouring, pseudocoloring as well as more sophisticated operations like volume rendering. All of VisIt's plots are plugins so you can add new plot types by writing your own plot plugins. See the wiki at www.visitusers.org for more details on creating new plot plugins or send an e-mail inquiry to visit-users@elist.ornl.gov.
