<h2>Projecting the slice to 2D</h2>
<p>
The Slice operator usually leaves sliced plots in 3D so you can position the slice with the plane tool. However, you might want the plot projected to 2D. When a sliced plot is projected to 2D, any 2D operation, like <b>Lineout</b>, can be applied to the plot. To project a plot to 2D, check the <b>Project 2D</b> check box in the<b> Slice operator attributes window</b>.
