<h2><p>Quitting VisIt when there are multiple user interfaces</h2></p>
<p>When you use the <b>Command Window</b>, VisIt launches the VisIt Python interface (CLI) to interpret the Python scripts that you enter into the <b>Command Window</b>. This means that you have two user interfaces attached to the same viewer component. When more than one user interface is attached to the viewer, VisIt asks you if you want to quit all user interfaces when you click the <b>Quit</b> option in the <b>Main Window's File menu</b> (see Figure10-6). If you choose to quit all user interfaces then VisIt totally quits. If you choose instead to just quit the GUI then the CLI program will remain active and just the GUI will terminate. This allows you to selectively close user interfaces that you no longer need. When all of the user interface programs (GUI, CLI, Java, etc.) attached to the viewer have closed, the viewer itself closes down.</p>
