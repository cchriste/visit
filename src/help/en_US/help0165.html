<h2><p>Specifying the slice cone</h2></p>
<p>You can specify the slice cone by setting various fields in the <b>Cone operator attributes window</b>, shown in Figure4-15. To specify how pointy the cone should be, type a new angle (in degrees) into the <b>Angle</b> text field. The cone is defined relative to its origin, which is the point at the tip of the cone. To move the cone, type in a new origin vector into the <b>Origin</b> text field. The origin is represented by three floating point numbers separated by spaces. Once the cone is positioned, you can set its direction (where the cone points) by entering a new direction vector into the <b>Direction</b> text field.</p>
<p>The cone can extend forever or it can be clipped at some distance along its length. To clip the cone at a certain length, check the <b>Cut cone off</b> check box and enter a new length value into the <b>Length</b> text field.</p>
