<h2><p>Formatting labels</h2></p>
<p>The Label plot provides several options for setting label format. First and foremost, you can set the label display format, which is how mesh node and cell numbers are displayed. By default, the Label plot will display labels in their most appropriate format with cell and node numbers for structured meshes displayed as logical i,j,k indices. Setting the label format is only possible for Label plots of structured meshes. To change the label format, select a new option from the <b>Label display format</b> combo box.</p>
<p>The Label plot's default behavior is to use the vis window's foreground color but if you want labels to be a specific color, you can turn off the <b>Use foreground color</b> check box and select a new label color by clicking on the <b>Label color</b> color button. </p>
<p>The height of the Label plot's labels is determined as a percentage of the height of the vis window containing the Label plot. The default label height is set at 2% but you can change the label height by entering a new value into the <b>Label height </b>spin box or by using the up or down arrows on the <b>Label height</b> spin box. Note that when you are plotting a mesh variable, VisIt will make more controls in the <b>Label plot attributes window</b> so you can set the color and height for cells and nodes independently (see Figure3-16).</p>
<p>Finally, the <b>Label plot attributes window</b> provides controls to determine the horizontal and vertical text justification used when drawing each label. To change the horizontal text justification, select a new value from the <b>Horizontal justification</b> combo box. To change the vertical text justification, select a new value from the <b>Vertical justification</b> combo box.</p>
