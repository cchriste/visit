<h2><p>Streamline Plot</h2></p>
<p>VisIt's Streamline plot must be initialized more completely before you click the <b>Draw</b> button to generate the plot. First of all, you must take special care to set the step length, which is the maximum length that will be integrated through the vector field for each step. The step length should be set to a value approximating the average width of the cells in the mesh to ensure that the streamlines are as accurate as possible. After choosing a suitable step length, be sure to specify a maximum number of steps. The maximum number of steps is the number of integrations that will be performed for each streamline. In a vector field that is free of attractors, a larger number for maximum steps will generate longer streamlines.</p>
