<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
A visualization window, also known as a vis window, is a window that displays plots and allows you to interact with them using the mouse. The vis window not only allows for direct manipulation of plots but it also provides a popup menu and toolbar that allow you to switch window modes, activate interactive tools, and perform commonly used operations. This chapter explains how to manage and use vis windows.
