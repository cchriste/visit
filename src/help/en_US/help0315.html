<h2>Changing a SIL restriction</h2>
<p>
Each set in the <b>Subset Window</b> has a small check box next to it that allows you to turn the set on or off. The check box not only displays whether a set is on or off, but it also displays whether or not a set is partially on. When a set is partially on, it means that at least one (but not all) of the subsets that comprise the set is turned on. When a set is partially on, its check box shows a small slash instead of a check or an empty box. Uncheck the check box next to a set name to turn the set off.

If you want to turn off the subset that is domain1, first click on the "domains" subset category to list the subsets in that category. Next, click the check box next to the subset name "domain1" and click the <b>Apply</b> button. The result of this operation, shown in figure, removes the "domain1" subset from the visualization. Note that the <b>Subset Window</b> "domain1" set's check box is unchecked and the top level set's check box has a slash through it to show that some subsets are turned off.
