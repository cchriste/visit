<h2>Showing node and zone numbers</h2>
<p>
The Label plot can display the node and cell numbers for the computational mesh if you have selected a mesh variable to plot. By default, the Label plot will display cell numbers only. The cell numbers will be displayed in the format most natural to the underlying mesh representation, which means that unstructured meshes will have cell numbers that are displayed as single integers while structured meshes will be displayed in i,j,k format when possible. If you want the Label plot to show a mesh's node numbers in addition to its cell numbers, you can click on the <b>Show nodes</b> check box. If you no longer want the Label plot to show the mesh's cell numbers, you can turn off the <b>Show cells</b> check box.
