<h2><p>Providing additional command line options</h2></p>
<p>The <b>Host Profile Window</b> allows you to provide additional command line options to the compute engine and database server through the <b>Additional options</b> text field. When you provide additional command line options, you should type them, separated by spaces, into the <b>Additional options</b> text field. Command line options influence how the compute engine and database server are executed. For more information on VisIt's command line options, see Appendix A. Most of the host profiles that are installed with VisIt specify the expected installation directory for VisIt so VisIt does not have to be in your path on remote computes.</p>
