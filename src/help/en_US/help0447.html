<h2>Setting the time state</h2>
<p>
<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure1"></a><img src="../images/Animation/animationtoolbar.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 1</i></td></tr></table></center><br><br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure2"></a><img src="../images/Animation/buttons.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 2</i></td></tr></table></center><br>There are several ways that you can set the time state for an animation. You can use the <b>VCR</b> controls to play animations or step through them one state at a time. You can also use the <b>Time slider</b> to access a specific animation time state. To set the animation time state using the <b>Time slider</b>, click on the time slider and drag horizontally to a new time state. The time state to which you drag it will be displayed in the <b>Cycle/Time</b> text field as you drag the time slider so you will know when to let go of the <b>Time slider</b>. Once you release the mouse button at a new time state, VisIt will calculate the visualized plots using the data at the specified time state.
</p>
<p>
If you prefer more precise control over the time state, you can type a cycle or time into the <b>Cycle/Time</b> text field to make VisIt jump to the closest cycle or time for the active database. You can also highlight a new time state for the active database in the <b>Selected files</b> list and then click the <b>Replace</b> button to make VisIt change the time state for the visualization.
