<h2><p>Setting curve attributes</h2></p>
<p>Curve plots have a few options that can be set to alter their appearance. You can set the curve's line style, which can be solid, dotted, dashed, or dash-dotted, by making a selection from the <b>Line Style</b> menu in the <b>Curve plot attributes window</b> (Figure8-13). If the Curve plot is difficult to see in the visualization window, try increasing the line thickness by making a selection from the <b>Line Width</b> menu. You can change the curve's color, by clicking on the <b>Color</b> button and selecting a new color from the <b>Popup color menu</b>. If you don't want the curve to have labels, you can turn them off by unchecking the <b>Labels</b> check box. Finally, you can make Curve plots display a small point glyph at each data point along the curve if you check the <b>Points </b>check box and set a point size in the <b>Point size</b> text field.</p>
