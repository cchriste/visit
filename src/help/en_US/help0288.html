<h2>Choosing a new center of rotation</h2>
<p>
When you are working with a 3D database and you have created plots and zoomed in on them, you should set the center of rotation. The center of rotation is the point about which the plots are rotated when you rotate the plots in navigate mode. Normally, the center of rotation is set to the center of the plots being visualized. When you zoom way in on plots and attempt to rotate them, the default center of rotation often causes plots to whiz off of the screen when you rotate because the center of rotation is not close enough to the geometry that you are actually viewing. To set the center of rotation to something more suitable, VisIt provides the <b>Choose center</b> button, which can be accessed in the <b>Popup</b> menu or in the <b>View</b> toolbar. Once you click the <b>Choose center</b> button, VisIt temporarily switches to pick mode so you can click on the part of your visualization that you want to become the new center of rotation. Once you click on a plot, VisIt exits pick mode and uses the picked point as the new center of rotation. After setting the center of rotation, VisIt will make sure that the picked point is visible at all times.
