<h2>Host Profiles</h2>
<p>
When VisIt launches a component on a remote computer, it looks for something called a <i>host profile</i>. A host profile contains information that VisIt uses to launch components on a remote computer. Host profiles allow you to specify information like: remote username, number of processors, parallel launch method, etc. You can have multiple host profiles for any given computer. Host profiles are most often used to specify options for running VisIt's parallel compute engine on remote computers and often the same host will have a serial host profile and several other host profiles with different parallel options.
