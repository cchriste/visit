<h2>Sharing a compute job</h2>
<p>
Some computers, notably Los Alamos National Laboratory's Q machine, place restrictions on the number of interactive sessions that a single user can have on the computer. To allow VisIt to run on computer systems that enforce these kinds of restrictions, VisIt can optionally force the database server and parallel compute engine to share the same job in the batch system. If you want to make the database server and parallel compute engine share the same batch job, you can click the <b>Share batch job with Metadata Server</b> check box on the <b>Host profiles Window's Advanced options tab</b>.
