<h2>Database correlations and time sliders</h2>
<p>
When you open a database for the first time, VisIt creates a trivial database correlation for that single database and creates a new logical time slider for it. Each database correlation has its own logical time slider. figure shows a database correlation as the active time slider.

<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure6"></a><img src="../images/MultipleDatabaseAndWindows/correlationtimeslider.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 6</i></td></tr></table></center><br>Suppose you have plots from time-varying database A and database B in the same visualization window. You can use the logical time slider for database A to change database A's time state and you can use the logical time slider for database B to change database B's time state. If you want to change the time state for both databases at the same time using a single logical time slider, you can create a database correlation involving database A and database B and then change time states using the database correlation's logical time slider. When you change time states using a database correlation's time slider, the time state used in each plot is calculated by using the database correlation's time slider's time state to look up the plot's expected time state in the database correlation. Thus changing time states using a database correlation also updates the logical time slider for each database involved in the database correlation.
