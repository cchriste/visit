<h2>Removing operators</h2>
<p>
You do not remove operators by clicking the <b>Delete</b> button as you do with plots. There are two ways that you can delete an operator from a plot. As its last two options, the <b>Operators</b> menu has options that remove one or more operators. To remove only the last applied operator, select the <b>Remove last</b> option from the <b>Operators</b> menu. To remove all operators applied to a plot, select the <b>Remove all</b> option from the <b>Operators</b> menu. Unless the <b>Apply operator to all plots</b> check box is checked, operators are only removed from selected plots. If you remove operators using the controls in the <b>Operators</b> menu, the plots that are in the completed state are immediately recalculated by the compute engine and redisplayed using the modified list of operators.

VisIt also provides controls that let you remove specific operators from the middle of a plot's operator list. First expand the plot list entry by clicking its <b>Expand</b> button and then click on the red <b>X</b> button next to the operator that you want to delete. The red <b>X</b> button deletes the operator to which it is attached. When an operator is deleted using the red <b>X</b> buttons, the plot is reset back to the new state so you must click the <b>Draw</b> button to tell VisIt to regenerate the plot. See figure for an example of deleting an operator from the middle of a plot's operator list.
