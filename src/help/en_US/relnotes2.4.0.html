<a name="General_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 2.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Host Profiles window was enhanced so it is possible to set the maximum number of nodes and processors for a given computer. If these limits are set then the viewer's profile chooser dialog prevents the user from choosing more nodes or processors than are allowed.</li>
  <li>The Compute Engine window was enhanced so it can show the number of processors using GPUs for rendering. The window now also shows the domain assignment used by the load balancer. In addition, these statistics are now read back from the engine that was actually launched so differences in number of processors requested vs used are apparent. This means that simulations can now accurately display their number of processors.</li>
  <li>VisIt is better able to detect the desktop geometry so it should not initially create the main window so it is too tall for the screen. When possible, care is also taken to avoid windows such as the MacOS X dock.</li>
  <li>Windows distributions now contain OpenMPI based parallel components and will be installed if the installer detects multiple CPUs. If OpenMPI is not already available on the machine, installation of parallel components will require admin privileges.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<a name="Advanced_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced features added in version 2.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Libsim was enhanced so it offers support for attaching mesh-sized ghost cell arrays to rectilinear, curvilinear, and unstructured meshes. This method for creating ghost cells allows any cell in the mesh to be a ghost cell so it is more flexible than the existing index-based approach to ghost cells, which still works. If a ghost cells array is added to a mesh then those values are used instead of the ghost zone indices. The new ghost zone approach allows different flavors of ghost cell, including VISIT_GHOSTCELL_BLANK, which lets you remove cell from a mesh. When older versions of VisIt connect to a newer Libsim with these ghost cell enhancements, the new functions have no effect.</li>
  <li>Libsim was enhanced to support setting cell and node origin in mesh metadata.</li>
  <li>Libsim was enhanced to support setting spatial extents in mesh metadata.</li>
  <li>Cumulative query selections were enhanced so they can cache intermediate results obtained from executing filters over time. This accelerates operations that modify the histogram such as changing the summation rule, display type, and bin properties. Modifying the selection variable list or ranges do not benefit from caching.</li>
  <li>The constructive solid geometry meshing now supports two-dimensional grids and common 2D primitives like lines and circles.</li>
  <li>The 'time' portion of the legend can now be turned off.</li>
  <li>Queries over time no longer display time information in their legends.</li>
</ul>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 2.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Anders Petersson of the WPP code project has contributed a reader for WPP's <i>volimage</i> files.</li>
  <li>The <i>BOV</i> reader now reports time information correctly.</li>
  <li>A leak in the <i>DDCMD</i> reader was fixed.</li>
  <li>The ANALYZE reader was improved so it uses less memory.</li>
  <li>The PDB reader was improved to handle the case where the ireg array was not time-varying but the file was time-varying.</li>
  <li>The Image reader enhanced so it can return vector data for image volumes.</li>
  <li>The CGNS reader was fixed so it can successfully read data from files that have been grouped using automatic file grouping.</li>
  <li>VisIt can now read XSF (XCrySDen Structure) files containing periodic structures (molecule, polymer, slab, and crystal with lattice vectors) and general grids.</li>
  <li>The Tecplot reader now supports shared variables, in both its ASCII and binary flavors.  It also allows use of the strand ID, though it still assumes zones are equivalent to domains.</li>
  <li>Tecplot also now supports database options which allow the user to override automatic guessing of coordinate variables.</li>
  <li>VisIt's VTK reader now serves up 1D rectilinear grids as curve variables as well as scalar variables, making them plottable using the Curve plot.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Plot_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's plots in version 2.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Numerous changes were made to improve the robustness of the
      <i>Streamline</i> plot's pathline feature.</li>
  <li>Numerous changes were made to improve support in the <i>Streamline</i> 
      plot with AMR data.  VisIt's <i>Streamline</i> plot is now believed to work
      with AMR data in all cases.</li>
  <li>Multiple memory leaks with the <i>Streamline</i> plot were remoted.
      The <i>Streamline</i> plot is now believed to be leak free.</li>
  <li>A memory leak was fixed with the <i>Mesh</i> plot.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Operator_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's operators in version 2.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>An Extrude operator was added. The Extrude operator lets you extrude points, lines, and 2D cells along a vector to create lines, surfaces, and volumes.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<a name="Expression_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's expression language in version 2.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<a name="Query_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's picks and queries in version 2.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Arguments for queries in the CLI are now passed as named arguments (keyword args) or a python dictionary. eg <i>Query("MinMax", use_actual_data=1)</i> or <i>Query("NodeCoords", element=1, domain=2)</i></li>
  <li>Default arguments for a query may be retrieved in the CLI via <i>GetQueryParameters(QueryName)</i> The method returns a python dictionary, which can be modified and used as the arugment to the Query.
  <li>You no longer have to specify all the accepted arguments for a query if the default values will suffice.</li>
  <li>Picking via the Query Window has been consolidated into one method <i>Pick</i> with more options for what type of pick should be performed. The CLI options for Pick currently remain the same.</li>
  <li>Options for controlling start/end times and stride for queries-over-time can now be specified in the Query window, and as keyword args in the CLI. eg <i>QueryOverTime("Min", start_time=50, end_time=250, stride=5).</i>Defaults if not specified remain <i>start_time=0, end_time=numTimeStates, stride=1)</i>.</li>
  <li>Pick no longer returns timestep information for single-timestate data.</li>
  <li>Pick output for Tensors and Arrays has been cleaned up.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Other bugs fixed in version 2.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Named selections based directly on a database instead of a plot were not recreated when restoring a session.</li>
  <li>Cumulative query selections based on a database instead of a plot failed to be created when a compute engine did not already exist. Furthermore, if the selection used expressions that had not been previously used in plots, the selection would not be calculated.</li>
  <li>The VisIt GUI would fail to connect to a remote computer if the remote username was changed in the <i>Change username</i> window while connecting to the remote computer. The viewer would connect to the remote computer but it would also send the gui a message that caused it to stop waiting for a connection from the metadata server.</li>
  <li>The POV-Ray exporter no longer uses the locale when generating color tables; this could insert commas instead of decimal places and cause errors when parsing the file in POV-Ray.</li>
  <li>Saved lineout results from a multi-domain dataset create single curve instead of one curve per domain.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

  
<a name="Config_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to configuration files in version 2.4</font></b></p>

</ul>
  
<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 2.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt was ported to an enhanced version of VTK 5.8.0.</li>
  <li>There is now an "aprun" option for launching parallel jobs.</li>
  <li>Queries can now have custom widgets added to the QueryWindow, allowing more useful controls of options.</li>
  <li>VisIt's static build has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Simulations that link to libsim can now also link in the rest of VisIt's libraries statically when VisIt has been built statically <i>(pass -DVISIT_STATIC:BOOL=ON to cmake)</i>. This means that the usual loading of the simulation runtime library is not done and all symbols are resolved at link time. This change makes it possible to deploy libsim-instrumented simulations on platforms that lack shared libraries.</li>
  <li></li>
