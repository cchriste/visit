<h2>Deleting a color table</h2>
<p>
To delete a color table, click on a color table name in the color table list and then click the <b>Delete</b> button. You can delete all color tables except for the last color table. VisIt makes no distinction between built-in color tables and user-defined color tables so any color table can be deleted. When you delete a color table, the active color table is set to the color table that comes first in the list. If a color table is in use when it is deleted, plots that used the deleted color table will use the default color table from that point on.
