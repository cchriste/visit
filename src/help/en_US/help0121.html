<h2><p>Surface Plot</h2></p>
<p>The Surface plot (example shown in Figure3-35) takes 2D scalar databases as input and adds a height component to the variable's mesh, resulting in a height map that is then pseudocolored by the plotted variable. You might want to use this plot to examine 2D datasets because features of the plotted variable are highlighted by the height of the plot in addition to being highlighted by the plot's colors.</p>
