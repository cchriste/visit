<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure19"></a><img src="../images/Quantitative/lineoutwindow.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 19</i></td></tr></table></center><br>The Curve plot uses the Lineout operator to extract data from a database along a linear path. The Lineout operator is not generally available since curves are created only through reference lines and not the <b>Plot menu</b>. Still, once a curve has been created using the Lineout operator, certain attributes of the Lineout can be modified. Note that when you modify the Lineout operator attributes, it is best to turn off the <b>Apply operator to all plots</b> check box in the <b>Main Window</b> so that all curves do not get the same set of Lineout operator attributes. Some Lineout operator attributes can be set globally in the <b>Global Lineout Window</b>, which is accessed by clicking on Lineout option in the <b>Main Window's Controls </b>menu. The <b>Global Lineout Window</b> contains mainly the same options as the<b> Lineout operator attributes</b> window but it applies to all Lineout operators.
