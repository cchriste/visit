You might, for example, want to see the behavior of pressure vs. density colored by temperature. The Scatter plot can take up to four scalar fields as input and can use up to three of them as coordinates for the created point mesh while one input variable can be used to assign colors to the point mesh. The Scatter plot provides individual controls for setting the limits of each input variable and also allows each input variable to be scaled so that all of the resulting points from disparate data ranges fit in a unit cube.

The <b>Scatter plot attributes window</b> is divided into two tabs: <b>Inputs</b> and <b>Appearance</b>. The <b>Inputs</b> tab is further subdivided into tabs for each input variable. Each tab for an input variable contains controls that pertain to selecting the input variable, settings its limits, or setting the role that the input variable will perform within the Scatter plot. Each input variable can have one of five roles that will be covered later. The <b>Appearance</b> tab contains controls for changing the Scatter plot's appearance. Under the two main tabs, the <b>Scatter plot attributes window</b> features a small section that lists the roles that are used in the plot and which input variables are assigned to each role.
