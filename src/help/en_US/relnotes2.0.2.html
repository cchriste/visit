<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 2.0.2 is primarily a bug fix release to release 2.0. It fixes additional bugs in release 2.0. Look <a href="relnotes2.0.0.html">here</a> to see a complete list of changes in release 2.0.  Look <a href="relnotes2.0.1.html">here</a> to see fixes to 2.0 in release 2.0.1.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.0.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Color tables that include transparency can now be saved in a session and restored properly.</li>
<li>Groups of Exodus files can now be read correctly.</li>
<li>Time is now properly reported for all Cosmos++ files.</li>
<li>Time iterating expressions now work on files that have meshnames that contain the '/' character.</li>
<li>Tools now cause an extra render to ensure their actors get removed from the vis window.</li>
<li>The Transform operator attributes window would reset its values incorrectly when using auto update and multiple plots. This caused the wrong values to be applied to the plot with the Transform operator, resulting in unwanted transforms.</li>
<li>The Lines reader was fixed so objects it creates have the proper reference count.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.0.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Basic NETCDF reader was enhanced to expose 2D arrays where one dimension is time as curves that vary over time.</li>
<li>The Scatter plot was enhanced so it can use data from Curve variables.</li>
</ul>
