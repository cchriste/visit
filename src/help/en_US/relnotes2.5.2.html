<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 2.5.2 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 2.5.2 is primarily a
bug fix release to release 2.5.1. It fixes additional bugs in release
2.5.1.  Look <a href="relnotes2.5.1.html">here</a> to see a complete
list of changes in release 2.5.1.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Configuration changes in version 2.5.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The host profiles for LLNL's atlas machine were removed due to machine retirement.</li>
<li>The <i>partition</i> in the host profile for ORNL's lens machine was changed from <i>analysis</i> to <i>computation</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.5.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Plots using variables created with the DataBinning operator would delete their actors when changing active plots in the plot list. This caused the plot to appear in the Pending state and lead to unnecessary re-execution of the plot.</li>
<li>Clearing pick points turns off the Spreadsheet plot's tracer plane.</li>
<li>The Revolve operator now properly handles vector data.</li>
<li>Build_visit no longer hangs with the message "initializing qt vars" when run in graphical mode.</li>
<li>Plots made using data from a libsim-instrumented simulation did not update their SIL restrictions when the simulation called <i>VisItTimestepChanged()</i>. This could cause existing plots' SIL restrictions to become out of date with respect to the simulation.</li>
<li>Splatter Volume plots now supports data with double-precision coordinates.</li>
<li>Spheral reader no longer converts its data to floating-point, but passes it down the pipeline in its native double-precision format.</li>
<li>The text in the "Time slider" annotation object no longer partially overlaps the time slider bar when it contains characters with descenders (i.e. "g", "j", "p", "q" or "y").</li>
<li>Fixed double-clicking on a '.visit' file on Windows so that VisIt will open the related database.</li>
<li>The linux-intel version of VisIt no longer displays the error message:
<p>Error opening plugin file:<br>/usr/local/visit/2.5.1/linux-intel/plugins/databases/libMITAPS_MOABDatabase.so<br>(/usr/local/visit/2.5.1/linux-intel/plugins/databases/libMITAPS_MOABDatabase.so: undefined symbol: H5DSis_scale)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.5.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Console output from remote mdserver or compute engines is now routed to VisIt's <i>Output window</i>. This ensures that the output is available for platforms such as MacOS X and Windows where the VisIt application does not use a console. Console output from those programs sometimes indicates the cause of client/server launch failures.</li>
<li>The Chombo reader can now handle anisotropic refinement ratios.</li>
</ul>
