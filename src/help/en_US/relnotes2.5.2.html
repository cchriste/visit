<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 2.5.2 is primarily a
bug fix release to release 2.5.1. It fixes additional bugs in release
2.5.1.  Look <a href="relnotes2.5.1.html">here</a> to see a complete
list of changes in release 2.5.1.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Configuration changes in version 2.5.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The host profiles for LLNL's atlas machine were removed due to machine retirement.</li>
<li>The <i>partition</i> in the host profile for ORNL's lens machine was changed from <i>analysis</i> to <i>computation</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.5.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Plots using variables created with the DataBinning operator would delete their actors when changing active plots in the plot list. This caused the plot to appear in the Pending state and lead to unnecessary re-execution of the plot.</li>
<li>Clearing pick points turns off the Spreadsheet plot's tracer plane.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.5.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Console output from remote mdserver or compute engines is now routed to VisIt's <i>Output window</i>. This ensures that the output is available for platforms such as MacOS X and Windows where the VisIt application does not use a console. Console output from those programs sometimes indicates the cause of client/server launch failures.</li>
</ul>
