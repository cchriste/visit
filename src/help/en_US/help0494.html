<h2>Automatic database correlation</h2>

<br><center><table border="0"><tr><td><a name="Figure16"></a><img src="../images/MultipleDatabaseAndWindows/correlatedialog.png"></td></tr><tr><td halign="left"><i>Figure 16</i></td></tr></table></center><br>VisIt can automatically create database correlations when they are needed if you enable certain global settings to control the creation of database correlations. By default, will prompt you to when it wants to create a database correlation. VisIt can automatically create a database correlation when you add a plot of a multiple time-varying database to a vis window that already contains a plot from a different time-varying database. VisIt first looks for the most suitable existing database correlation and if the one it picks must be modified to accommodate a new input database or if an entirely new database correlation must be created, VisIt will prompt you using a <b>Correlation question</b> dialog (figure). If you prevent VisIt from creating a database correlation or altering the most suitable correlation, you will no longer be prompted to create a database correlation for the list of databases listed in the <b>Correlation question</b> dialog.
</p>
<p>
By default, VisIt will only attempt to create a database correlation for you if the new plot's database has the same number of time states as the existing plot. You can change when VisIt creates a database correlation for you by selecting a different option from the <b>When to create correlation</b> combo box in the <b>Database Correlation Window</b>. The available options are: <b>Always</b>, <b>Never</b>, and <b>Same number of states</b>. You can change the default correlation method by selecting a new option from the <b>Default correlation method </b>combo box. Finally, you can prevent VisIt from prompting you when it needs to create a database correlation if you turn off the <b>Prompt before creating new correlation</b> check box.
