<h2><p>Scatter plot wizard</h2></p>
<p>Plots are typically created in VisIt when you choose a variable from one of the <b>Plot menus</b>. Since the Scatter plot takes as input up to four input variables and typical plot creation only initializes one variable, you can imagine that if a Scatter plot was created the usual way, only one of its many input variables would be initialized. Furthermore, to initialize the plot, you would have to open the <b>Scatter plot attributes window</b> and select the other variables. Since that would not be a very straightforward way to create a Scatter plot, VisIt now has support for plot wizards. A plot wizard is a simple dialog window that pops up when you select a variable to plot. A plot wizard leads you through a series of questions that allow VisIt to more fully initialize a new plot. The Scatter plot is the first of VisIt's plots to support plot wizards. The <b>Scatter plot wizard</b> prompts you for the scalar variable to use for the Y-Axis, the variable to use for the Z-Axis (optional), and the variable to use for the plot's colors (optional).</p>
