<h2><p>Using the Decimate operator</h2></p>
<p>The Decimate operator simplifies mesh geometry. This can be useful for producing models that have lower polygon counts than the model before the Decimate operator was applied. Models with lower polygon count can be useful for speeding up operations such as rendering. The Decimate operator has a single knob that influences how many cells are removed from the input mesh. The <b>Target Reduction</b> value is a floating point number in the range (0,1) and it can be set in the <b>Decimate operator attrbutes window</b> (see Figure4-19). The number specified is the proportion of number of polygonal cells in the output dataset "over" the number of polygonal cells in the original dataset. As shown in Figure4-18, higher values for <b>Target Reduction</b> value cause VisIt to simplify the mesh even more. </p>
