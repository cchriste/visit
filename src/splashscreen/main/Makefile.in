# Modifications:
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Feb 14 15:15:26 PST 2002
#    I added the utility library.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Mar 26 16:34:01 PST 2002
#    I removed the rpc library.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Mon Apr 15 16:47:54 PDT 2002
#    Added the winutil library.
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed May 22 08:43:01 PDT 2002
#    Put LDFLAGS in front of the object files.  g++ does not preprocess the
#    command line and take in flags, so some flags are effectively ignored if
#    not positioned correctly.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 12 14:30:29 PDT 2002
#    Unified include directories.  Changed MOC location.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Sep 30 12:51:19 PDT 2002
#    Added pthreads since they are sometimes required by libcomm.so.
