# Modifications:
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Aug  4 14:31:06 PDT 2000
#    I changed the order the that subdirectories are listed in SUBDIRS.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Sep 7 16:52:17 PST 2000
#    I made the engine build before the viewer.
#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Thu Oct 12 11:07:22 PDT 2000
#    Add visit_vtk to list of subdirectories.
#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Tue Oct 17 14:55:20 PDT 2000 
#    Moved visit_vtk before engine in list of subdirs.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Oct 31 15:36:54 PST 2000
#    Added vtkqt.
#
#    Hank Childs, Fri Jan  5 13:02:23 PST 2001
#    Removed directory tools from list of subdirectories to build.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Feb 16 13:08:59 PST 2001
#    I moved the line continuation character for the SUBDIRS variable so
#    that we don't have the situation where we have a line continuation
#    with no contuation line.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Mon Feb 26 15:44:11 PST 2001
#    I modified the makefile to compile the files in the plot directory tree.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri May 11 14:39:48 PDT 2001
#    Added lib directory.
#    Added "source" target to plots directory.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jul 26 02:44:25 PDT 2001
#    Added operator plugins.
#    Removed the "make source" needed to resolve old circular dependencies.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 27 13:48:59 PDT 2001
#    Added "parclean" make target.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Aug 24 13:01:54 PDT 2001
#    Fixed engine directory's parclean.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Fri Aug 31 14:37:28 PDT 2001
#    Added the splash screen.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Sun Jul 8 15:05:34 PST 2001
#    Added visitpy directory.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jan 16 13:05:30 PST 2002
#    Removed parclean target since serial and parallel now build concurrently.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Mon Jun 10 16:40:29 PDT 2002
#    Got rid of RSUBDIRS.  Gutted portions so as to move to a central location.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 12 14:38:14 PDT 2002
#    Added bin and include to the subdirectories.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul 15 00:56:14 PDT 2002
#    Added tools/xml to the subdirectories.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Jul 12 18:02:31 PST 2002
#    Added help directory.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul 22 12:13:05 PDT 2002
#    Made it build the whole tools directory.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Aug 14 16:43:09 PST 2002
#    I made it build the java directory.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Aug 27 16:02:22 PDT 2002
#    Added database plugins.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon May 5 09:38:47 PDT 2003
#    I added the launcher directory.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Jun 19 13:12:07 PST 2003
#    I removed the splashscreen.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Thu Nov 20 10:04:46 PST 2003
#    I made the build in the help directory optional.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Apr 22 11:38:06 PDT 2004
#    I moved common/winutil to the top level because of some dependencies
#    on the components directory. I did this because of prebinding on the
#    Mac.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Fri Dec  2 00:11:45 PST 2005
#    Added third_party_builtin directory
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Wed Dec  7 14:02:41 PST 2005
#    Changed order of SUBDIRS so third_party_builtin is built first, not last
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Mar 21 14:27:38 PST 2006
#    I made it build libsim.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Nov 22 11:41:54 PDT 2006
#    I added a top level visitmodule target.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Jun 29 09:28:51 PDT 2007
#    Removed the setting of the DISTRIB variable.
#
#    Hank Childs, Sat Feb  9 15:31:35 PST 2008
#    Renamed components directory to avt.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Feb 13 11:50:03 PST 2009
#    I made sim be built before plugins since the SimV2 reader has a
#    dependency on libsimV2runtime.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Wed Mar  4 18:02:00 PST 2009
#    Made it work for dbio-only build.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Jun 3 15:45:55 PST 2009
#    I added an engine-only build option.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Tue Jun 16 15:32:47 PDT 2009
#    Added logic to check for possible environment variable collision with
#    VisIt's Makefile variables.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Jun 18 10:42:16 PDT 2009
#    I made the new check be configurable.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Thu Jun 18 21:22:07 PDT 2009
#    Made logic to check for env. var collisions work on Darwin. Made
#    execution of target dependent on the LACK OF existence of a '-g' in
#    CXXFLAGS. This way, this target will not get executed for developers
#    for common cases but will for users. Made the check NOT configurable.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Tue Jul  7 14:42:20 PDT 2009
#    Made env. var collision check exit the make if it finds problems. The
#    expectation is that this is a reasonable stop-gap since the issue will
#    go away entirely upon moving to CMake.
#
#    Hank Childs, Tue Jul 14 14:28:36 PDT 2009
#    Remove '==' inside test, as it doesn't work on my machine (it is not
#    compliant).
