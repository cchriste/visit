# Modifications:
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Mar  2 14:23:59 PST 2001
#    Add the contour plot.
#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Tue Mar  6 09:42:44 PST 2001 
#    Add the surface plot.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Wed Mar  7 16:32:56 PST 2001
#    Add the plot plugin manager.
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed Mar 21 14:04:27 PST 2001

#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Wed Mar 21 16:46:49 PST 2001 
#    Add the mesh plot.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Mar 26 17:25:18 PST 2001
#    Made it build the fast volume plot.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu May 10 13:53:52 PDT 2001
#    Removed the manager directory.  Also, since the plugins must be built
#    last (on AIX) but the .o's must be built first (for a temporary hack),
#    I added a "make source" target.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jun  1 17:51:54 PDT 2001
#    I removed the IsoSurfaceVolume and RangeVolume plots temporarily.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jul 26 02:45:45 PDT 2001
#    Removed the old "source" target needed to resolve circular dependencies.
#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Wed Oct 17 14:49:14 PDT 2001 
#    Add Subset plot, remove Material plot..
#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Fri Jan 18 13:53:37 PST 2002 
#    Add Curve plot. 
#
#    Sean Ahern, Mon Jun 10 16:40:29 PDT 2002
#    Gutted while moving things to a central location.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 19 11:19:21 PDT 2002
#    Made it work with auto-generated makefiles.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul 22 12:11:28 PDT 2002
#    Made it assume the directory makefiles were already built before "all".
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Oct 4 15:12:32 PST 2002
#    I added the streamline plot.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Fri Nov 15 15:20:20 PST 2002
#    Added the ability for plots to be "optional", just like operators.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Tue Jan 21 10:38:37 PST 2003
#    I renamed the FastVolume plot to Volume.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed May  7 10:19:31 PDT 2003
#    Added Boundary plot.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri May  9 11:22:47 PDT 2003
#    Added FilledBoundary plot.
#
#    Hank Childs, Thu Jun 26 23:17:01 PDT 2003
#    Added Histogram plot.
#
#    Hank Childs, Tue Sep 23 07:28:20 PDT 2003
#    Added Tensor plot.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Oct 30 12:03:04 PST 2003
#    Removed Kerbel plot entirely from this makefile.
