<h2>About</h2>
The base VTK code without ParaView is contained in the VTK directory and makes up vtkOSPRay.  vtkOSPRay is a VTK module which utilizes Intel's OSPRay ray tracing framework (http://ospray.github.io) for rendering.  This offers a performant CPU rendering package with enhanced image quality and includes plugins for the commonly used visualization tools ParaView and VisIt.

<h2>Building</h2>
vtkOSPRay is currently built as part of the pvOSPRay and visitOSPRay builds. A stand-alone library build process will be released soon.
