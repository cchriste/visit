//  Class: avtLocalizedCompactnessFactorQuery
//
//  Purpose:
//      Calculates the localized compactness factor of a data set.  This is
//      defined as follows:
//      1) For each point in space, determine the compactness around that
//      point, defined as the percent of the surrounding spherical region that
//      is the same material.
//      2) The localized compactness factor is the average over all points in
//      space.
//
//  Caveats:
//      1) To ease parallel implementation issues, the LCF starts by resampling
//      onto a rectilinear grid so that this calculation can be done in serial.
//      2) User settable knobs are:
//         2a) the radius to consider
//         2b) a weighting factor that, for a given point, allows portions of
//             the spherical region that are closer to count more heavily.
//      3) This calculation works in 2D, but it assumes that the 2D data set
//         is in cylindrical coordinates and it will revolve the data set
//         around the X-axis.
