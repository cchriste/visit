//  Class: avtFacePlanarity
//
//  Purpose: Calculates either relative or absolute face planarity for a cell.
//  Face planarity is defined ONLY for cells that have at least one face that
//  is non-simplex (e.g. non-triangle). That means wedge, pyramid and hex
//  cells. For a given face, a face planarity measure of zero means all the
//  points on the face lie on the same plane. This is true by definition for
//  triangular faces. For quadrilateral faces, the distance between the 4th
//  node and the plane defined by the first 3 nodes represents the face
//  planarity measure. If this distance is divided by the average of the 
//  lengths of the 4 edges, it is a relative planarity measure for the face. 
//  Finally, the face planarity measure for a whole cell consisting
//  of potentially several non-triangular faces is taken to be the maximum
//  over its faces.
