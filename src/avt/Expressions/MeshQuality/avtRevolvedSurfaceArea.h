//  Purpose:
//      Calculates the surface area a 1D line would have it if were revolved
//      around the line Y=0.
//
//  Programmer: Hank Childs
//  Creation:   March 18, 2003
//
//  Modifications:
//    Kathleen Bonnell, Tue Feb  7 14:14:33 PST 2006
//    Added revolveAboutX. Changed args of GetLineArea from vtkCell, to double.
//    Added GetCellArea.
//
//    Hank Childs, Wed May 21 15:55:53 PDT 2008
//    Re-define GetVariableDimension.
