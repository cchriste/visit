//  Class: avtResampleSelection
//
//  Purpose: Specify data selection by a uniform resampling. The context in
//  which resampling behaves as a data "selection" operation is one in which
//  the input is a non-discrete (e.g. continuous) representation of the data.
//  In that case, resampling has the effect of selecting a finite set of 
//  points (the samples) fron an infinity of points (the continuum) in which
//  the data actually originates.
//
//  The default is a uniform sampling 100 samples in each of X, Y and Z
//  between -10.0 and 10.0 on each axis.
//
//  To specify samples on an orthogonal slice on the Y-axis, for example,
//  you would specify starts[1] = stops[1] = Y-index and counts[1] = 0
//  with other values as desired.
