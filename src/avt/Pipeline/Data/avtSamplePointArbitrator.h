//  Class: avtSamplePointArbitrator
//
//  Purpose:
//      Decides which sample point to use when multiple cells map to the same
//      sample.  The algorithm it uses is defined by its derived type.
//
//  Programmer: Hank Childs
//  Creation:   January 23, 2002
//
//  Modifications:
//
//    Hank Childs, Thu Feb  5 17:11:06 PST 2004
//    Moved inlined constructor and destructor definitions to .C files
//    because certain compilers have problems with them.
//
//    Hank Childs, Sat Jan 29 10:22:56 PST 2005
//    Made ShouldOverwrite be pure virtual.  This is now an abstract type.
//
//    Hank Childs, Tue Dec 18 10:04:43 PST 2007
//    Define private copy constructor and assignment operator to prevent
//    accidental use of default, bitwise copy implementations.
