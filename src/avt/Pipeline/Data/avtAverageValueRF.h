// ****************************************************************************
//  Class: avtAverageValueRF
//
//  Purpose:
//      The derived type of ray function that will give the average value along
//      a ray.  A value must be set for what contribution a sample point makes
//      if it is not valid (typically the minimum for the dataset).
//
//  Programmer: Hank Childs
//  Creation:   December 1, 2000
//
//  Modifications:
//
//    Hank Childs, Sat Feb  3 20:49:43 PST 2001
//    Made ray function return a color instead of a value.
//
//    Hank Childs, Thu Feb  5 17:11:06 PST 2004
//    Moved inlined destructor definitions to .C files
//    because certain compilers have problems with them.
