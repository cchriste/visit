//  Class: avtSingleFilterFacade
//
//  Purpose:
//      This is for a class that wants to acts as a facade, but will only be
//      a facade to a single filter (so that class probably is trying to change
//      the interface, like make it a plugin filter).  This class' only 
//      purpose is to decrease the number of virtual functions that the derived
//      types must define.

//  Modifications:
//
//    Hank Childs, Tue Jun  7 15:04:09 PDT 2005
//    Use new interface for creating facaded filters.
//
//    Tom Fogal, Tue Jun 23 20:37:54 MDT 2009
//    Added const versions of some methods.
