# Modifications:
#     Brad Whitlock, Mon May 22 14:58:40 PST 2000
#     Adapted the script to handle VisIt.
#
#     Eric Brugger, Tue Sep  4 09:22:51 PDT 2001
#     I removed the creation and distribution of help files.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Mon Nov  5 16:35:00 PST 2001
#     Retired "package" in favor of tar and gzip.
#
#     Eric Brugger, Mon Nov 19 09:50:18 PST 2001
#     I modified the tar command which creates the distribution file to
#     pipe the results of tar into gzip instead of using the -z option to
#     tar which only exists in gnu's version of tar.
#
#     Eric Brugger, Wed Nov 21 08:43:19 PST 2001
#     I replaced the tar command used to copy the distribution files with
#     a cpio command.  I also added user write permissions to all the
#     files in the distribution.
#
#     Jeremy Meredith, Tue Nov 27 14:58:37 PST 2001
#     Allowed a path in the distribution filename.  This path is only
#     a location to store the .tar.gz file, and is ignored when unpacking.
#
#     Hank Childs, Thu Mar  7 11:31:29 PST 2002
#     Allow for Exodus files not to be distributed.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Mon May 20 13:40:48 PDT 2002
#     Added a check to see if you specified a distribution file.
#
#     Brad Whitlock, Fri Jul 12 17:38:10 PST 2002
#     Added the option of creating and distributing the help files.
#
#     Hank Childs, Tue Aug 20 08:34:21 PDT 2002
#     Added support for not distributing the Verdict library.
#
#     Jeremy Meredith, Tue Aug 27 11:07:45 PDT 2002
#     Changed the way exodus is removed from the distribution.
#
#     Eric Brugger, Wed Nov 20 11:25:21 PST 2002
#     Modified the script to take into account the new location of the
#     verdict library.
#
#     Eric Brugger, Wed May 21 13:16:22 PDT 2003
#     Removed the -noexodus and -noverdict options.
#
#     Eric Brugger, Thu Nov 20 08:23:40 PST 2003
#     Pass along -withhelp option to source_files command.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Jun  3 10:12:39 PDT 2004
#     Added '-f' flag to the recursive chmod
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Mon Nov 29 18:52:41 PST 2004
#     Added -withtest option and code to add relevant test
#     files to list of files
#
#     Brad Whitlock, Thu Feb 17 16:37:11 PST 2005
#     I removed the -withhelp option from source_files because now it
#     returns at least the static HTML files in the help directory.
