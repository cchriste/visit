// Class: NameSimplifier
//
// Purpose:
//   This is a simple class that takes a group of host qualified file names
//   and removes the bits that it can to make shorter names.
//
// Notes:      
//
// Programmer: Brad Whitlock
// Creation:   Wed Feb 4 14:22:58 PST 2004

// Modifications:
//    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Apr  6 14:16:54 PDT 2004
//    Keep track of the filenames in a way made for adding the minimal amount
//    of text needed for ensuring they are unique.  Added UniqueFileName.
//
//    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Apr  7 12:12:48 PDT 2004
//    Account for the fact that not all input names had full paths.
