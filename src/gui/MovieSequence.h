// Class: MovieSequence
//
// Purpose: 
//   Movie sequence base class.
//
// Note:       This is the base class for movie sequences, which are sequences
//             of frames that can appear in a movie. This class primarily
//             deals with providing different user interfaces for the various
//             types of sequences and includes methods to set/get the
//             sequence values from the movie template file's DataNodes.
//
//             New movie sequence types are added by adding a new instance
//             of the movie sequence in the MovieSequenceFactory constructor.
//             Since that's the only place they are added, we could in theory
//             make these be plugins.
