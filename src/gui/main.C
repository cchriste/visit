//  Function: main

//
//  Notes:      
//
//  Programmer: Brad Whitlock
//  Creation:   Wed Jul 26 09:48:46 PDT 2000
//
//  Modifications:
//    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Nov 17 16:15:04 PST 2000
//    Removed initialization of exceptions and added general initialization.
//
//    Brad Whitlock, Mon Nov 27 16:10:21 PST 2000
//    I added a flag preventing the argument list from being messed with during
//    general initialization.
//
//    Jeremy Meredith, Fri May 11 13:52:51 PDT 2001
//    Added initialization of PlotPluginManager.
//
//    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jul 26 03:34:42 PDT 2001
//    Added initialization of OperatorPluginManager.
//
//    Brad Whitlock, Wed Sep 26 09:46:36 PDT 2001
//    Modified code so it can handle when plugins fail to load.
//
//    Brad Whitlock, Mon Oct 22 18:25:42 PST 2001
//    Changed the exception handling keywords to macros.
//
//    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Jan 14 17:12:34 PST 2003
//    Added setColorSpec(ManyColor) so that it will try to get a 24-bit
//    visual for the GUI windows, even if 8-bit is the default.
//
//    Hank Childs, Tue Jun  1 14:07:05 PDT 2004
