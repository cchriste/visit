// Class: QualifiedFilename
//
// Purpose:
//   This class contains filename information that includes: host,
//   path, filename. It should be used anywhere a filename is needed.
//
// Notes:      
//   This class was created to deprecate the usage of strings as
//   filenames. This is because it was often unclear how the file
//   information was stored in the string. This way, we always know
//   what is in a filename.
//
// Programmer: Brad Whitlock
// Creation:   Tue Sep 12 14:31:16 PST 2000
//
// Modifications:
//   Brad Whitlock, Mon Aug 26 17:04:06 PST 2002
//   I added a separator.
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Fri Mar 28 12:01:51 PDT 2003
//   I added a flag that contains the file's access and virtual bits.
