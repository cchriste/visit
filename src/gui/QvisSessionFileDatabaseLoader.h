// Class: QvisSessionFileDatabaseLoader
//
// Purpose:
//   Helps load session file databases before we tell the viewer to actually
//   load a session file. This class listens for mdserver cancelations, allowing
//   the mdserver cancel button to cancel session loading when done from the
//   GUI.
