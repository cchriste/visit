#   I added makemovie.py to the list of files that get distributed.
#

#   Renamed the MOC target so it would always get rebuilt.  There wasn't
#   enough dependency information to determine if the Qt version changed.
#
#   Eric Brugger, Tue Oct  5 10:47:23 PDT 2004
#   I replaced QTDIR with QT_BIN.
#
#   Mark C. Miller, Wed Feb 28 11:04:01 PST 2007
#   Added visit_plugin tool to DISTRIB
#
#   Eric Brugger, Fri Jun 29 09:17:48 PDT 2007
#   Removed the setting of the DISTRIB and NOT_DISTRIB variables.
#
#   Jeremy Meredith, Thu Aug 30 12:55:30 EDT 2007
#   Made the 'clean' target not remove things needed to correctly
#   generate dependencies.  That's now reserved for distclean.
#   In this case, it means removing moc only in 'distclean'.
#
#   Jeremy Meredith, Thu Sep  6 16:53:41 EDT 2007
#   Don't forget to remove the Makefile in distclean.
