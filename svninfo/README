The files in this directory are used to manage merges between branches.
You should only modify these files if you *really* know what you are doing.

Here's a brief synopsis of the process:

This directory contains two files: Rev_fromTrunk and Rev_toTrunk. Inside 
of the trunk, the values of these two files are always the same. They are
placed inside the trunk so that a "svn cp" command, to make a branch, will
guarantee that the branch contains these key files.
On branches, the contents of these files can differ. These files simply 
contain a revision number. Each time a merge script is executed, 
it updates the revision number.

Consider the following example. The trunk is at revision 923. Branch1 and 
Branch2 are created from revision 923. Branch3 is later created at revision 
940. (Since no one merged into the trunk, the original directory structure of 
Branch3 will be identical to that of Branch1 and Branch2.) Work happens on all 
three branches. Branch1 gets up to revision 960, Branch2 gets to 970 and 
Branch3 to 980.

The developer of Branch2 decides to merge. So the script merge_branch_to_trunk 
is called. The script knows that it needs to merge from revision 923->, 
since it spawned from a 923 version of the trunk. At the end, the Branch2 
file of "Rev_toTrunk" is updated to contain 981, the current revision number. 
Rev_fromTrunk and Rev_toTrunk are also updated to be 981 on the trunk.

Now the tricky part, additional branch work. If the developer of Branch1 wants 
to merge in the latest version of the trunk, that developer would call 
"merge_trunk_to_branch". That script would merge versions 923-981 onto 
Branch1. At the end, the file "Rev_fromTrunk" would be updated to 981 
(or maybe 982). Then, the developer would call "merge_branch_to_trunk". 
Because the value of "Rev_toTrunk" is still 923, it will merge all of its 
changes from 923 to 981. The new revision on the trunk would be 983 and the 
trunk would be update so that its "Rev_fromTrunk" and "Rev_toTrunk" 
would both contain 983. Branch1's "Rev_toTrunk" would also be updated with 983.

When Branch3 is ready to go, it follows the same pattern. Merging in from the 
trunk would bring in revisions 940-983, since that branch was created at 
revision 940.


RC development will be similar, except that it will also contain 
the files "Rev_fromRCTrunk" and "Rev_toRCTrunk".  The file Rev_toTrunk will
be used for the RC to merge into the trunk, but the files Rev_fromRCTrunk
and Rev_toRCTrunk will be used when merging RC branches to and from the RC
trunk.
